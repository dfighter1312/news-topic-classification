business,economy,Trade remedy lawsuits soar as Vietnamese exports rise,"Le Trieu Dung, head of the Trade Remedies Authority of Vietnam under the Ministry of Industry and Trade, said as Vietnam's export turnover continues to grow, more investigations and trade remedies measures were inevitable.Before 2005, there were just 52 trade remedies related lawsuits on Vietnam's exports, but this number has quadrupled to 208 since then, Dung said at a recent conference.The number of lawsuits has been rising, especially as certain countries importing from Vietnam are also importing materials from areas where trade remedies have been imposed, on steel or aluminum, Dung noted.As Vietnam's exports continue to grow, competition intensifies in importing markets, prompting hurt domestic businesses to ask their governments to investigate and apply trade sanctions on Vietnamese goods, he explained.Vietnam has also applied trade sanctions as a way to enable a fair competitive environment and protect customers' rights. The trade ministry has imposed such sanctions in 23 cases, half of them anti-dumping duties, as of November.In 2001, Vietnam's trade turnover reached $30 billion, and this tripled six years later to $100 billion. In 2011, the figure was $200 billion and eventually increased to $517 billion in 2019.

business,economy,Vietnam should prioritize domestic borrowing over foreign to fund recovery: expert,"To have enough resources to support the economy, the country needs to diversify its methods, mobilizing public money, borrowing from foreign financial institutions and temporarily using unspent investment money and foreign exchange reserves like other countries have done for their economic stimulus program, former acting chairman of the National Financial Supervisory Commission Truong Van Phuoc said.However, at this time, mobilizing domestic resources in both dong and foreign currencies is the optimal solution. ""Issuing domestic bonds will help us repay principal and interest more proactively.""Finance Minister Ho Duc Phoc recently mentioned the possibility of mobilizing VND180 trillion ($7.8 billion) from the public through the issuance of bonds for the economic recovery package.International borrowing creates a long-term obligation to pay interest and principal in foreign currencies, pressurizing the nation’s finances. Part of the current public debt includes foreign loans. If Vietnam issues bonds in the domestic market, it can pay interest and principal in dong.Even with [domestic] bonds in foreign currencies, though interest and principal will be paid in USD, that foreign exchange can return to the banking system or circulate in the national financial system, he explained.Vietnam can mobilize foreign currencies from local people as foreign exchange has accumulated for many years in the Vietnamese economy. Since the 2000s, $3-4 billion in remittances flowed into Vietnam every year, also increasing year after year. Remittances are expected to reach $20 billion this year, Phuoc said.Vietnam is a major destination for foreign direct investment and portfolio investment, and so has a large foreign currency surplus.""I think the amount of idle money in the economy is fairly large. Instead of keeping USD at home or depositing it in banks at zero percent interest, many people will buy government bonds in foreign currencies with an annual interest rate of around 2 percent,"" he said. ""Financial institutions can also consider this because interest rates on loans in USD in the global market are very low now.""Vietnam could use its foreign exchange reserves for economic recovery programs, but it should consider this the last resort, Phuoc noted. The country has nearly $100 billion in foreign exchange reserves.The economy grew by 5.64 percent year-on-year in the first half of the year, but contracted by 6.17 percent in the third quarter as the fourth wave of Covid raged, leading to a growth of 1.42 percent for the first nine months, according to the Ministry of Planning and Investment.The government targets  in 2022 despite the potential challenges posed by the Covid-19 pandemic.","Vietnam,domestic borrowing,fund,recovery"

They should also receive wavers in tax and certain fees, it stated.Loans will help companies bounce back after a long time fighting the pandemic as their resources have dwindled, said Nguyen Trung Cong, CEO of iVIVu.Cong added the tourism industry needs to adapt to the new normal, including digitalizing services and focusing on small groups as people refrain from big travel groups.Leaders of Zannier Hotels Bai San Ho proposed more specific guidelines on domestic travel be communicated as people are reluctant to make travel plans due to inconsistencies in implementing policies between localities.Huynh Thi Mai Thy, country market manager for Traveloka Vietnam, said if the reopening of Phu Quoc proves a success, more flights could be scheduled to other locations like Quang Ninh Province, home to popular Ha Long Bay.","Vietnam,tourism,recovery"

business,economy,"Vietnam economy recovering, contraction bottoms out: WB","The update released Friday says the country faced challenges in restarting the economy after prolonged social distancing periods, but the contraction has bottomed out.With HCMC and other provinces in the South progressively lifting restrictions in October, major mobility indicators have bounced back and economic activities resumed.The recovery has been particularly strong in grocery and pharmacy, which have reverted close to pre-pandemic levels. In contrast, mobility in workplaces has rebounded at a slower pace than typically observed in previous outbreaks.Current workplace mobility trends largely reflect the developments in southern provinces where resuming full production has proved difficult because of shortages of input materials as well as labor.The industrial production index increased in October, largely driven by the resumption of production activities in HCMC and surrounding industrial hubs. The most dynamic subsectors included food and beverage, tobacco, garment and footwear, rubber and plastic products, metals, and furniture, registering double digit month-on-month growth rates.The manufacturing PMI jumped from 40.2 in September to 52.1 in October, exceeding the 50.0 no-change benchmark for the first time in five months, indicating significant improvement in economic conditions.Retail sales growth accelerated from 4.4 percent month-on-month in September to 18.1 percent in October thanks to the easing of social distancing measures. Sales of services, which were affected more severely by the fourth outbreak, continued to recover at faster pace than sales of goods.The trade surplus reached $2.85 billion in October as merchandise exports increased by 5.7 percent year-on-year while import growth moderated to 6.9 percent from 10.2 percent in September.FDI commitments fell 47.4 percent month-on-month in October after three months of strong recovery. This reversal likely reflects ""the seasonality and chunkiness"" of FDI, the WB said. Meanwhile, inflation remained subdued despite fuel price hikes.A credit growth of 14.2 percent year-on-year in October, similar to September, reflected ongoing recovery of economic activities from the fourth outbreak, particularly in the services sectors.Specifically, the growth of credit to the services sector, which accounted for over 60 percent of total credit to the economy, settled at 15.6 percent year-on-year in October after steadily slowing since May.The October budget registered a surplus of $1.2 billion after two months in deficit, the WB update notes.According to the WB, a more proactive fiscal policy would better support economic recovery. The approved value-added tax reduction for businesses in traveling, hospitality and entertainment industries in November and December are expected to help boost domestic demand.As the economy re-opens and the number of new confirmed cases increases, persisting with the rapid pace of vaccination and increasing vigilance in testing and quarantining should help avoid a new wave of infections, the bank says.Inflation should be carefully watched as strengthening domestic demand amid rising energy prices around the world may create upward pressure on prices, the WB cautions, adding that financial sector health should be closely monitored.The economy grew by 5.64 percent year-on-year in the first half of the year, but contracted by 6.17 percent in the third quarter as the fourth wave of Covid raged, leading to a growth of 1.42 percent for the first nine months, according to the Ministry of Planning and Investment.The government targets in 2022 despite the potential challenges posed by the Covid-19 pandemic.","WB,economic recovery,tax reduction,economic growth"

There was no traffic jam, and it was warmer than riding the motorbike,"" said the 30-year-old, who works for a startup.The experience is similar to that of Thailand where he had worked for a couple of years, Khanh said.Several Southeast Asian countries have had a head start over Vietnam in establishing metro networks.Indonesia’s first metro line began operations in 2019, Thailand’s Bangkok got its Sky Train in 1999, while Singapore’s North-South Line started service in 1987.Vietnam approved the Cat Linh – Ha Dong route in 2008 and targeted it becoming operational by 2013, but several hurdles in land acquisition, design changes and contractual conflicts delayed construction by eight years.Despite the inordinate delay, the first metro route is a ""historic"" one, part of a network of metro route that will ease traffic burden on roads, Hanoi deputy chairman Duong Duc Tuan said at the inaugural ceremony Saturday.The Cat Linh – Ha Dong route is one of 10 metro routes planned for Hanoi by 2030 with a total length of 417 kilometers - 82 percent of it elevated and the rest underground.Passengers are seen on the Cat Linh – Ha Dong Metro Route, November 6, 2021. Photo by VnExpress/GIang HuyAnother route, the Nhon – Hanoi Railway Station, is under construction. Its elevated section is set to become operational by the end of next year.This route, built with French technology and standards, will be linked to the Cat Linh – Ha Dong route.Tuan called for more investment into metros to boost their construction speed, noting that it is taking 8-10 years to complete a route in Vietnam.But some experts are concerned that the euphoria and ""excessive"" focus on metro routes are sidelining potentially troublesome issues.""The lack of a bus network to bring people to the stations and the limited number of parking spaces will likely deter users from making the metro their main means of transport,"" said architect and urban planning expert Ngo Viet Nam Son.A metro needs to have an occupancy rate of 80-90 percent to ensure profit. A lower rate could make this means of transport an economic burden as the government won’t be able to recoup its investment because higher fares are not an ideal solution, he told ""Authorities seem to be so drawn toward building metros that they forget buses must be the main means public transport in a city,"" he said, adding that buses cost less to operate and offer users more travel options.To improve the current metro network, authorities need to either sell bus and metro tickets together with lower fares, or give metro users free bus trips, Son said.For future metro projects, the government could consider acquiring land alongside the line and auction them later to recoup its investment and create more organized urban areas where the metro goes, he suggested.Hanoians queue up to try out new metro.

business,economy,Multiple sources can be tapped for Covid-19 stimulus package: experts,"The Ministry of Planning and Investment is collecting feedback on a stimulus package to facilitate economic recovery following the devastation wreaked by the fourth Covid-19 wave.Nguyen Duc Kien, head of a group of consultants to Prime Minister Pham Minh Chinh, said that the package will be valued at least VND500 trillion ($22.03 billion), equivalent to the nation’s annual public investment.Some experts have said that the figure could even reach VND800 trillion, and that fiscal policy is an option to mobilize funding.Vietnam is set to have a public debt ratio of 43.6 percent of GDP this year, far below the 55 percent threshold. It also has nearly $100 billion in foreign exchange reserves.Using fiscal policy to mobilize funds for recovery might cause budget deficit and public debt to rise, but these figures will still remain under control and at lower levels than other countries in the region, said Can Van Luc, member of the National Monetary Advisory Council.International organizations like the International Monetary Fund, the World Bank and the Asian Development Bank are willing to ""give us loans with interests rates of under one percent,"" he told .""If exchange rates are stable, foreign loans are possible.""Whether the stimulus package is VND500 trillion or VND800 trillion, there will be sufficient resources, Kien said.The government can use the money to invest in projects without seeking to recoup capital, because this will generate taxes from businesses that benefit from the package, he addedOne example is a public-private partnership (PPP) highway, which often takes 15-20 years for the government to recoup its investment from tolls, Kien said.Instead, if the government joins hands with the developer in building the road, businesses that benefit from it the road will see their revenues rise and will pay higher taxes, helping recoup the original investment, he added.In terms of monetary policy, experts advise that the government avoids repeating the 2009 story when a stimulus package caused inflation to surge.Luc said that incentive loans should be given to loss-making companies with collateral and recovery prospects.The support should last one year at most because state coffers are limited, he added.Ministry of Finance Ho Duc Phoc had said last week the ministry was considering  at annual interest rates of 2-3 percent. Priority would be given to infrastructure project developers.Another possible source of money is idle cash with the public, which can be tapped through foreign currency bonds and even short-term bonds.Overspending could rise in 2022 and 2023, but will drop in 2024, ensuring that the five-year target of controlling overspending is achieved, Phoc said last month.Luc, however, said that foreign currency bond issuance should be considered carefully as it could exert pressure on foreign exchange rates and the macro economy.Experts say that another way to mobilize funds is to clear administrative blockages in existing projects, which will boost private investment.Over 2,000 real estate projects are facing delays due to administrative procedures, and if these issues are resolved the government can collect money from land fees while businesses create jobs.Le Duy Binh, CEO of consultancy Economica Vietnam, said public investment was extremely slow at the moment, and speeding this up will help boost growth and fuel manufacturing as well as consumption.","Vietnam,stimulus,package,Covid-19,money,cash,support"

Hopes that the pandemic would remain under control helped optimism reach a 29-month high.But issues around staffing levels remained despite the wider return to growth.Employment continued to fall markedly in October, with a number of firms indicating that some of their staff members had returned to their hometowns during the latest wave of the pandemic and had yet to return to their place of work.""The problems with transportation and supply chains haven't gone away, making the sourcing and distribution of products challenging,"" said Andrew Harker, economics director at IHS Markit.Input costs increased at the fastest pace since April 2011 and at one of the sharpest rates in the survey's history, the report noted.Efforts to guard against likely future price rises encouraged firms to expand their input inventories for the third month running in October, it added.","Vietnam,PMI,manufacturing"
business,economy,Vietnam prioritizes six pillars for economic recovery: PM,"The master plan for economic recovery includes controlling Covid-19, ensuring social security, creating jobs, reviving businesses, developing infrastructure, reducing administrative procedures, and fighting corruption, he said Friday at the World Economic Forum Country Strategic Dialogue on Vietnam.There would be six policy pillars to realize the goal, he said at the online event that he co-chaired.First, the country needs to restore supply chains to ensure the circulation of goods and safe and smooth production by enterprises in the new normal.The second pillar is to promote manufacturing to restore economic growth and stabilize people’s lives.Third, the country needs large-scale investment, especially in inter-regional transport infrastructure, green energy and national digital infrastructure, which will serve as new growth engines for the economy.Fourth, Vietnam needs to step up efforts to address difficulties confronting businesses, including foreign enterprises.The fifth pillar is to improve institutional reformsto international standards, one of the key strategies to achieve a breakthrough in development in the next decade.The sixth and most important pillar is developing human resources. The country needs to promote economic restructuring and improving productivity.He called on investors to join with the government to safely restore production in industrial parks, economic zones, high-tech parks, and export processing zones to safeguard supply chains.""The Vietnamese government is ready to strengthen dialogue and coordination within the framework of a public-private partnership.""He said models such as the public-private partnership program for sustainable agriculture would be replicated in other areas as well.The economy has started recovering from the fourth wave of Covid, with foreign direct investment rising by 12 percent year-on-year in October and exports by 17 percent, he said.Retail sales of goods and services were up 17 percent, he said.Inflation in the first 10 months was only 1.81 percent, showing that the difficulties were only temporary, and growth prospects remain strong in the long run, he said.Foreign companies offered recommendations for improving trade at the forum.They sought more public-private partnerships to develop digital infrastructure to promote digital transformation.Klaus Schwab, executive chairman of the WEF, said the forum would continue to offer Vietnam support and partnership.The country would continue to achieve impressive growth in the coming decades and remain on course to become a leading economy in the region, he added.WEF’s Country Strategic Dialogue on Vietnam is a key event under a support program to increase investment as global economies recover from Covid.","Vietnam,World Economic Forum,PM,Pham Minh Chinh"

We don’t know what to do"".With travel demand being low, Bang cannot raise fares either, but the company cannot keep suffering losses for too long and will have to consider hikes if fuel prices continue to rise.Fuel prices have risen by 40-50 percent this year to a .Global prices have shot up since supply is failing to meet the demand stimulated by the resumption of economic activities as Covid-19 is gradually being controlled.Since last month fuel prices have been adjusted upward four times in Vietnam, putting pressure on the fuel price stabilization fund.""Businesses are scrambling to lower all costs to survive,"" Tran Duc Nghia, CEO of Hanoi logistics firm Delta International, said.The 40-50 percent increase this year is like ""a blow"" to transport companies, and they need to hike prices by 5-10 percent to meet the increased expenses, he said.But it is not easy to raise fares right away since contracts exist, he pointed out.The rise in logistics costs has a knock-on effect on other sectors too.Phan Phuc Son, deputy director of the Saigon – Ha Long Hotel in the northern province of Quang Ninh, has seen the cost of food, shampoo and soap rise following the fuel price hikes.""We plan to reopen at the end of this year with special offers like reducing room rates by 50-60 percent to stimulate tourism demand. But with the increase in costs, we will be forced to increase rates"".This could keep guests away, he feared.A beverage company executive in HCMC, who asked not be identified, said some suppliers have asked to increase prices by 10-30 percent due to increasing fuel costs.""We are under extreme pressure to raise our prices if suppliers continue to demand higher rates.""Some experts have suggested cutting taxes and fees, which account for around 60 percent of fuel prices, to ease the pressure on businesses and consumers.Hoang Van Cuong, vice president of the National Economics University in Hanoi, said: ""Many sectors have been suffering due to the pandemic, and now fuel prices.

business,economy,Global hike pushes Vietnam fuel price to 7-year high,"The government has hiked fuel prices up by 40.23–52.59 percent this year with the latest increase Tuesday bringing the popular fuel RON 95 to VND24,330 ($1.07) per liter, highest since September 2014.Global prices have also been rising. Brent futures rose 0.5 percent, to settle at $86.40 a barrel Tuesday, while U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude ended 1.1 percent higher at $84.65.Those were the highest closing prices for both global benchmarks since October 2014.A global supply shortage and strong demand in the U.S., the world's biggest consumer, is said to be the reason behind the increase.Gasoline and distillate consumption in the U.S. is back in line with five-year averages after more than a year of depressed demand.While China's red-hot power and coal markets have cooled somewhat after government intervention, energy prices remain elevated worldwide as temperatures fall with the onset of the northern winter,  reported.Since last month, Vietnam has pushed up fuel prices four times, but the combined increase this year is still lower than that of global rates thanks to the fuel price stabilization fund, the Ministry of Industry and Trade and the Ministry of Finance said in a joint statement Tuesday.They noted that global rates have increased 59.08–76.03 percent this year.However, the price stabilization fund, set up to offset fluctuations in global fuel prices, is seeing shortages.As of Tuesday, state-owned fuel distributor Petrolimex had a negative VND262 billion balance in its stabilization fund. At state-owned PVOil, the negative balance was VND697 billion as of Oct. 11.By the end of August, 15 of 35 fuel companies in the country reported a combined negative balance of VND1.47 trillion.Together with the remaining sum from the other 20 companies, the total balance of the fund stands at VND600 billion now.Experts have said further price hikes in the future can deplete the balance. The fund’s balance had fallen to a negative VND620 billion in mid-2019.The high fuel prices have raised concerns of rising inflation.Ngo Bich Lam, former head of the General Statistics Office, said that a 10 percent increase in fuel prices will lower GDP by around 0.5 percent and pump up the Consumer Price Index (CPI), which measures inflation, by 0.36 percentage points.This shows the strong impact of fuel price fluctuations on the economy, he said.Some people have mentioned the possibility of lowering fuel tax to offset the increase. Tax and fees account for over 60 percent of fuel prices.At VND4,000 per liter, or 16.4 percent of the current price, environmental tax is one of the biggest boosters of fuel prices.The Ministry of Industry and Trade and the Ministry of Finance are considering lowering fuel taxes, including environmental tax, to keep domestic prices stabile, Le Viet Nga, deputy head of the domestic markets under the trade ministry, had said at a press briefing last month.A fuel distributor in Hanoi who did not want to be named said that the government could lower taxes for biofuel E5 RON 92 by VND1,000 per liter from the current VND3,800.This 26 percent discount will reduce impacts of the price hike on businesses and citizens at a time the economy is only beginning to recover, he said, adding that it would also boost consumption of the biofuel, which is cheaper than RON 95.Vietnam imported $2.93 billion worth of fuel in the first nine months, up 15.3 percent year-on-year, according to Vietnam Customs.","Vietnam,fuel prices,inflation,gasoline"

The frequency will be increased from the second week with a train leaving every 10 minutes.After six months, the service will be extended to 10.30 p.m., and there will be a train every six minutes during rush hour.Built by China Railway Sixth Group Co Ltd, the project took 10 years to complete with hurdles and conflicts delaying the work several times.Its cost increased by 57 percent from the original estimate to VND18 trillion ($868 million), with 77 percent of it coming from official development assistance loans from China.The city of 8.3 million people is plagued by traffic congestion during rush hour due to the large number of motorbikes and cars.","Vietnam,metro,Cat Linh Ha Dong,Hanoi"

Some small karaoke lounges have decided to sell their systems, stopping their business.Like karaoke lounges, some bars and pubs are selling bottled cocktails and other alcoholic drinks in the form of take-away.Vu Tran Quynh Anh, owner of Con Voi Bar in HCMC’s Thu Duc City, said its bottled cocktail revenue is only one-tenth of its revenue when the bar operates normally.Bars’ take-away drinks attract few customers because people often go to bars to listen to music, dance and meet others, Anh said, noting that 60 percent of customers come to bars for space and interaction.Anh said she hoped HCMC would resume on-site dining and entertainment services in November.""HCMC will gradually resume on-site dining and other services so people could regain their livelihoods,"" city chairman Phan Van Mai told the press Friday. From next week, the city would start allowing eateries in low-risk areas to serve customers on their premises, he said.The municipal Department of Industry and Trade on Oct. 19 proposed the muncipal authorities allow all restaurants and eateries to resume on-site services, except for those offering alcoholic drinks.","on-site dining,take-away,entertainment service"

My work was stable. It was only disrupted by Covid,"" said the 37-year-old woman, who used to run an eatery that was the main source of income for her family of four.As Quang Nam does not have a lot of industrial parks, and there is limited area to farm rice, people like Duong and her husband are unable to find suitable jobs in the central province.She can work at a textile company in her hometown, but the salary of VND6–8 million ($263–350) per month is lower than what she can make in HCMC.Duong is among 1.3 million workers who left major localities in the south for their hometowns between July and September; but as the country looks to kick-start its economy in the new normal, she and many others are looking for ways to return to the south to find work.Another Quang Nam resident, Le Quoc Nhat, 29, is waiting to get the second Covid-19 vaccine dose to return to work in HCMC.Nhat, who returned to Vietnam after studying abroad in Israel, finds HCMC a vibrant city where he and his friends can easily discuss and follow up on business opportunities.Many of his friends have worked hard and secured positions with a company there, which give them stable income, he said.""There are jobs in my hometown, but the salary and positions are not as good as before. Many people are too old to learn new skills to find a different line of work.""Quang Nam has recorded more than 10,000 people returning from HCMC and other southern localities during and after the fourth Covid-19 wave.Of 6,500 returnees who responded to a recent survey, only 15.5 percent said they plan to stay back and work in the province. Most of the rest said they had not made up their mind.Nguyen Qui Quy, deputy director of Quang Nam’s Department of Labor, Invalids and Social Affairs, said that 100 big companies in the province are looking for nearly 17,000 workers.However, most workers seem to be looking to return to HCMC and other southern localities instead of staying in the province.This is because since 20 years ago, when there were few industrial parks in Quang Nam, people have been leaving for the south to find jobs. Many have settled down there. They only returned to Quang Nam now to protect their lives, he said.""People have got used to the life in the south, and they have high salaries. Citizens have the right to make their choices,"" Quy said.But this also means that companies in the province’s nine industrial parks and 22 industrial clusters are having trouble recruiting people, he added.The central province of Thua Thien Hue is also experiencing similar difficulties in retaining its returnees.Of 25,160 people of working age who returned, less than half (44.6 percent) want to stay back and work in the province, while the rest want to go back to the south or find work abroad.Chairman Nguyen Van Phuong said it was a challenge to arrange enough jobs for over 25,000 people, even though it is the desire of provincial leaders. The province will continue to expand its industrial hubs and call for more investment to create more jobs in the future, he added.Another central province, Nghe An, has seen 52,000 people of working age return during the fourth wave, and its labor department estimates that at least half of them want to return to the south for work.The department said 84 companies in the province have registered to recruit just 29,000 workers.In the south, the Mekong Delta region is recording the highest ratio of labor shortage at 30.6 percent, according to a recent study by the General Statistics Office.Meanwhile, there is high recruitment demand in the southern localities that are already established industrial hubs.Industries in dire need of workers include leather, textiles, garments and electrical equipment.HCMC alone needs 57,000 workers in the last three months of this year in trading, garments, footwear, restaurants and hospitality establishmentsNguyen Si Dung, deputy head of the National Assembly Office, said the majority of workers will return to the south after local outbreaks are brought under control.The recent reverse migration has shown the need for southern localities to improve the quality of life for migrant workers, providing them with housing and education for children, he said.Hoang Van Cuong, vice principal of the National Economics University in Hanoi, said it would take a long time for southern localities to regain in full their pre-pandemic labor pool after the en masse departure of workers.In the long run, the government needs to re-distribute labor nationwide to avoid the overcrowding in major cities where contagion risks are high, he added.","Vietnam,workers,south,central,migration"

The ratio will increase gradually, he said.""Factories in industrial hubs are not majorly impacted by the fact that workers return to their hometowns.""This is because companies were still paying their employees with a portion of their salary and 750 companies still imposed onsite manufacturing. These measures kept workers committed to the company.Before the pandemic, 17 industrial hubs in Ho Chi Minh City had over 320,000 workers in 1,500 factories.A total 820 were closed due to social distancing as of Sep. 30, plunging 244,000 workers into unemployment.","Vietnam,workers,HCMC,industrial hub"

It is followed by France with $3.62 billion and Germany with $2.25 billion.European investment is forecast to keep increasing in the medium and long terms, mainly in high-tech industries.To attract EU investment, many provinces and cities are acquiring lands around industrial zones, building infrastructure and creating a skilled workforce in agriculture, manufacturing and logistics and simplifying administrative procedures.Trade between the EU and Vietnam has also prospered in the year since EVFTA took effect despite the hurdles caused by Covid.This year, it has risen by nearly 12 percent year-on-year to $54.6 billion, with Vietnam’s exports being worth $38.5 billion.Vietnam’s main exports have been phones and components, computers, other electronic products and components, shoes, textiles, garments, machinery, equipment and appliances, tools and spare parts, and iron and steel products.Vietnam is still struggling to comply with the stringent sustainability and other technical standards of the EU market.

There is a sense of urgency since the South Korean maker of parts for LCD screens and refrigerators has been unable to fulfill orders in the last few months during the period of social distancing in HCMC.It is trying to persuade workers to return to HCMC by sending them messages that their safe travel would be taken care of and they would get vaccinated, Lee said.Trieu Thien Vu, human resources officer at Taiwanese rice cracker maker Want Want Vietnam in Tien Giang Province, said: ""We are urgently recruiting employees for production lines and administration such as head of quality, head of

operation manager of staffing and outsourcing services in HCMC at recruitment company ManpowerGroup Vietnam, said labor shortages in major cities and industrial hubs are having a severe impact on labor-intensive sectors like electronics, textile, wood, footwear, tourism, and hospitality.During the four months of social distancing, millions of workers saw their incomes drop, and concerns about the pandemic and social security caused many to leave cities, he said.Between July and September 15, some 1.3 million migrant workers had already , according to data released by the General Statistics Office.Companies are increasing salaries and benefits for workers, and also considering giving promotions and opportunities for training and career development, he added.Daeyoung could not promise higher salaries but is making changes in policies to offer workers better benefits, Bok said.The company is focusing on hiring locally to avoid a similar labor crisis in the future should another social distancing period come, he added.Nissei Electric Vietnam Company in Tien Giang is making plans to hire as soon the southern province eases all pandemic-related restrictions, some of which are still in place.The Japanese cable maker has only fulfilled half its orders this year and needs more workers to complete the rest by the end of the year, human resource officer Thien Nga said.But she does not know the exact number of new people needed since the company is still waiting to return to normal production.One of its advantages is that many workers have returned to southern localities and the labor pool there is bigger.""After the pandemic is controlled, it is expected that the labor supply can meet the company’s demand,"" Nga said.Nissei, which also has production facilities in HCMC, earlier this month posted job vacancies for administrators in production, assembly and and quality inspectors in the city.Nearly 57 percent of companies in the country plan to start recruiting

Province, said.The company has been getting more applications than it needs for a number of positions in production, planning, purchasing, warehouse management, and inventory control.Some multinationals are facing challenges in hiring foreign experts in senior positions due to the difficulties in bringing them into the country and limited international flights, Nguyen Thu Trang, ManpowerGroup Vietnam country head for permanent recruitment, executive search and consulting services, said.""Most companies have stopped the recruitment of foreign experts except in special cases permitted by the governments.""Companies that could not do without foreign experts have turned to local expats, she said.Son of ManpowerGroup said the fourth wave has taught companies that they need

business,industries,Offshore wind power capacity to reach 36 GW by 2045,"It will increase to 4 GW by 2030, 10 GW by 2035, 23 GW by 2040. Offshore wind power will account for some 2.6 percent of the total electricity generation capacity in 2030 and 10.8 percent in 2045. Offshore wind power farms will be located mainly in the north and the south of the country.In the previous draft of the plan, the Ministry of Industry and Trade had set a target of lifting offshore wind power capacity to 2-3 GW, or 1.5-2 percent of the total, by 2030.At a meeting held to discuss the latest draft Friday, Mathias Hollander, senior manager of the Global Wind Energy Council (GWEC), said Vietnam can have offshore wind power capacity of 5-10 GW by 2030. The country’s offshore wind power generation has an efficiency of over 50 percent, similar to that of hydroelectricity, he noted.According to GWEC calculations, Vietnam will have to invest $10-12 billion for the first 4-5 GW of offshore power wind capacity, but wind is an infinite source, so the country will not have to keep feeding wind power farms as it does with coal or gas-fired plants.Meanwhile, the unit cost for 1,000 kWh of electricity generated by an offshore wind power farm is around $83, down from $255 in 2010. It is expected to further drop to $58 by 2025.With a coastline of 3,260 km, low sea levels and high wind speeds (7-10 meters per second at a height of 100 meters), Vietnam is an emerging offshore wind power magnet in Southeast Asia, experts say."," offshore wind power,power development master plan"

Another portion is transferred from our partners and the company's own farm in Lam Dong Province.""In addition, there were many problems with inter-provincial traffic at the moment. Covid-19 testing has also contributed to the hike in business costs, the rep said.A  study found raw material costs had increased by 10-70 percent and transportation costs by 10-20 percent. Gas and petrol prices have continuously increased to record levels in recent times, causing more difficulties for F&B businesses.Recently, many businesses have also suggested that in order to deal with the current situation, operators need to reduce the environmental protection fee to control the price of gasoline.

business,industries,Vietnam gains from rising US shrimp demand,"Growth is eight times higher than that of total shrimp exports, which rose 2.6 percent to $2.76 billion.The Vietnam Association of Seafood Exporters and Producers (VASEP) said in a recent note U.S. demand remains high, especially as the economy resumes after Covid-19 outbreaks and as the end-of-year shopping season approaches.September was the 10th month in a row the U.S. saw shrimp imports rise. On average, it has imported over $800 million each month in the past 10 months.The U.S. has been hiking up shrimp imports from Ecuador since the beginning of the year, but as the latter faces a supply shortage, Vietnam has an opportunity to boost exports there, VASEP said.Vietnamese exporters will also likely benefit from the Christmas shopping season in Europe where demand is set to rise, it added.Shrimp exports to the EU in the first nine months rose 10 percent year-on-year to nearly $408 million.The U.S. was Vietnam’s biggest shrimp export market in the first nine months, accounting for 28 percent of the total, followed by the EU, 15 percent, and China, 11 percent.","Vietnam,shrimp,exports,US,seafood,fishery"

Key imports included machinery, equipment, tools, parts, and raw materials for the production of garments, textiles and footwear.Foreign companies would seek ways of investing in Southeast Asian countries, including Vietnam, instead of power-deficient China,  quoted an expert as saying.Johan Annell, partner at Asia Perspective, a consulting firm that works primarily with Northern European companies operating in East and Southeast Asia, told : ""Some companies were on the fence about investing in China. They choose to not go ahead now.""The investments each run into the tens of millions of dollars, he said. While China is still a ""very strong destination"" for manufacturing, he said the businesses are now looking to invest in Southeast Asia instead, particularly Vietnam.China is experiencing a severe power shortage, mainly due to stronger pressure from its emission reduction goals and higher prices of coal used in thermal plants. Many factories in China, including aluminum refineries, garment producers and soya bean processors, have had to reduce or even stop operations.Chinese authorities are calling for increasing coal production and transport power stations. They are also considering increasing power prices to reduce demand,  reported.China, the world’s biggest coal consumer, imported 197.69 million tons in the first eight months of this year, down 10 percent year-on-year.","China power shortage,electricity price,materials,accessories,import,Vietnamese producers"
business,industries,Property price surge to halt after reopening,"Once the ""living with Covid-19"" scheme has been activated, the property market would not post growth until the second or even last quarter next year, said economist Dinh The Hien.No market sees prices increase forever, he said, adding there had already been a surge in property prices between 2016 and 2019, and from 2020 to the end of the second quarter this year.However, the fourth Covid-19 wave has left a severe impact on property trade volume, which makes the scenario of a continued rise in prices unlikely, Hien said.Some projects in November might see a price hike but the same trend won’t happen in the whole industry, he added.In the last four months, investors have been struggling with plunging income that have dragged down property trading volume in the major markets of Ho Chi Minh City, Hanoi, Da Nang, Binh Duong and Dong Nai.Tran Khanh Quang, CEO of real estate developer Viet An Hoa, said there would likely be more sellers than buyers as the economy reopens.In the next three to six months the market would likely fluctuate, while its recovery depends largely on the success in controlling and adapting to the pandemic, he said.Even though the offering prices might rise, real negotiations would go the other way and buyers could get their desired property at 5-10 percent discount, Quang added.Data from property company Propzy shows although offering prices for property in HCMC have risen 10 percent year-on-year, negotiated prices are actually 4.2 percent lower.Huynh Phuoc Nghia, senior consultant for Global Integration Business Consultants, said the fourth Covid-19 wave could turn upside down the business plans of investors in at least the next six months.This means in this quarter and the next, the property industry would face many challenges, he added.","Vietnam,real estate,property"
business,industries,Inefficient plastics recycling costs Vietnam up to $2.9 bln a year,"Only 33 percent of the total 3.9 million tons of the commonly used plastics disposed per year in Vietnam are recovered and recycled, according to a new study by International Finance Corporation (IFC) and World Bank.This means 75 percent of the material value of the plastics – equivalent to $2.2-2.9 billion per year – is lost.""Rapid urbanization and a rising middle class have significantly increased consumption of plastic products and packaging, making regional emerging markets including Vietnam a hot spot for plastics pollution,"" said Carolyn Turk, World Bank country director for Vietnam.However, investments in waste management infrastructure have not kept pace, she added.There are several reasons for the high unrecycled rate, including the lack of sustained local demand for recycled plastics, heavy reliance on plastic scrap imports, absence of design-for-recycling standards and a waste management system that prioritizes collection and disposal over recycling.Plastic pollution caused by environmental leakage to the marine environment is especially acute for Vietnam given its long coastline.Several recommendations for Vietnam to unlock additional material value through plastic recycling include enabling plastic circularity through policies, increasing waste collection and sorting, and mandating design-for-recycling standards for all plastics, especially packaging.""A circular economy is critical for Vietnam to meet low-carbon growth targets. Recycling plastics not only addresses plastics pollution, but also avoids greenhouse gas emissions and saves valuable material resources,"" said Kyle Kelhofer, IFC country manager for Vietnam, Cambodia, and Lao PDR.Improving the business case for plastic recycling will mobilize increased private sector investment to help address the scourge of plastics pollution, he added.","Vietnam,plastic,recycle,environment,report"
business,industries,Strategies for safe resumption by businesses,"Since mid-September Quang, who owns a wood business in southern Binh Duong Province, has been preparing to resume production on Oct. 1 after more than a month of closure due to the pandemic.But to reopen, businesses must meet Covid safety conditions that are still to be announced by the Ministry of Health.Many other wood production enterprises in Dong Nai and Binh Duong are also keen to reopen but are concerned about the safety guidelines.Industry trade groups have said the regulations should spell out the travel and other rights for fully vaccinated people and those who have recovered from Covid, pointing out the vaccination would only then be meaningful.The policy of ""living with"" Covid should be simple and not involve red tape, they said.The guidelines should be easy to apply and have legal status so that businesses could strategize without having to seek further permissions from provincial authorities, they said.Local authorities should help businesses adapt and not create unnecessary hurdles, they said.The Vietnam Logistics Business Association said a reputable third party should be authorized to help businesses adopt safety regulations to help ease the burden on authorities.The draft guidelines by the Ministry of Health allow businesses to organize testing for their employees. At least 20 percent of high-risk workers and partners such as raw materials providers need to be tested periodically. Employees who are fully vaccinated or have recovered from Covid are exempt.Businesses in yellow zones, or medium Covid risk areas, need to organize tests every second week while those in orange and red zones, high and very high risk areas, need to test every week.The trade groups have urged authorities to reduce the testing rate for high-risk workers from 20 percent to 10 percent to reduce costs and improve workers’ morale.Periodic testing should not be required for some high-risk people such as motorcycle taxi drivers and delivery workers since most of them have been vaccinated, they said.Testing should only be required in high-risk locations with frequent human contact such as ports, airports, logistics centers, goods distribution centers, and headquarters of state agencies, they said.Many associations said businesses should be allowed to treat their workers for Covid, only seeking support from authorities for severe cases.","Vietnam,safe resumption,businesses"
business,industries,Hanoi garment shops struggle to attract customers despite big discounts,"Dozens of shops on Nguyen Trai, Cau Giay, Kim Ma, Hue Street, and Chua Boc Street have signs saying ‘sales’. Most offer 50-70 percent discounts on all products, but footfall is still low, their owners said two days after reopening.Hoang, the owner of an export garments shop in Dong Da District, said: ""The store usually has sales of VND10 million ($431) per day when it offers discounts on end-of-summer clothes, but now it is only VND6 million.""But he did say the sale is late this year and in other years it started before Sept. 2. He was worried if he could earn enough money to import winter clothes since they are more expensive than summer clothes given the current difficult situation.""I just hope that the pandemic is controlled in the near future so that the store can stabilize its business. In the last two months I received the government’s tax support for business households, but that is not enough to set off rent and overcome inventory.""Phuong, the owner of a women's fashion shop on O Cho Dua Street, said: ""Before April 30, the shop was still doing well. But since then people have had no need to buy more clothes because they can't go anywhere"".She only opened for three days from Sept. 28 to try and sell the stocks of summer clothes she imported a few months ago before closing the shop and switching to online sales because of lack of demand and sales staff.""Employees returned to their hometowns when the outbreak began (in late April) and are unable to return to Hanoi.""She said even if she hires new employees they need to be guided by the old staff and observed for two or three months before being given the store key.Selling online has its share of problems like lack of delivery workers and high shipping prices, she said.""If I don't import new goods, customers will not be interested in coming to the store, but there is no guarantee the new clothes will sell well. I really am at a loss.""Ha My has been selling online for several months, selling on Facebook and live-streaming support from her cousin twice a week.She said she plans to sale her store on Cau Giay Street to focus on online selling, explaining: ""The rent did not go down when the store closed and this stagnant business situation may last for a long time"".","Hanoi,garment shops,Covid"
business,industries,No incentive price extension for wind power plants: ministry,"Speaking to correspondents at a regular ministry press briefing, Hoang Tien Dung, head of the Electricity and Renewable Energy Authority, said many localities had sought an extension for three to six months since southern provinces, where many wind power plants are coming up, have had long lockdowns due to Covid-19, which have slowed down constriction progress.The FITs for offshore and onshore wind power currently stand at 9.8 cents and 8.5 cents per kilowatt-hour applicable for 20 years for plants that begin commercial generation before Nov. 1.For plants built after Oct. 31 prices will be determined through a bidding mechanism.Under the mechanism, which is being developed by the Ministry of Industry and Trade, wind power plants will negotiate electricity prices with buyers based on a price frame announced annually by the ministry.According to data from national utility Vietnam Electricity (EVN), 106 wind power plants are registered, of which 21 with a total capacity of 819 MW are already operational.FIT is a policy mechanism designed to speed up investment in renewable energy technologies by offering long-term contracts to renewable energy producers.Its goal is to offer cost-based compensation to renewable energy producers, providing price certainty and long-term contracts which help finance renewable energy investments.At the press briefing, Deputy Minister of Trade and Industry Do Thang Hai said his ministry would consider further reducing electricity prices by 10-30 percent to benefit businesses hit by the pandemic.Since 2020, the EVN has lowered prices five times, for commercial and household users.","Vietnam,wind power,FIT price,EVN,electricity price"

It requires one third of its drivers pick up the kit between 6 a.m. and 4 p.m. every day since the frequency of testing is once every three days.They self-test on the spot under the supervision of specialized staff. ""On average, there are 10-15 drivers every hour at a test point,"" Gojek said.Food delivery startup Baemin also said more drivers returned to work after it began distributing the free test kits.A company spokesperson said: ""The number of drivers has increased by about 35 percent compared to September 24. Many drivers like this policy and are excited to go out on the road"".Another food and grocery delivery service said in the past four days thousands of its shippers had done the quick tests at home. It also allows drivers to get tested at medical facilities, and grants them VND500,000 ($21.88) for testing if they complete 60 deliveries between September 24 and 30.The company with the largest number of delivery workers in Ho Chi Minh City, Grab, has also seen a large number of drivers come to receive the free kits.Grab said there has been no congestion or large gatherings at the kit distribution spots.","Vietnam,ride-hailing,shipper,HCMC,self-test,test kit,Covid"
business,industries,Vietnam private carriers seek zero interest loans,"The airlines are bearing high costs while revenue has declined drastically, but they have to maintain equipment and workforce so as to restart when the market recovers, VABA vice president and general secretary Bui Doan Ne, said at a recent meeting to discuss a bailout package for enterprises.Ne suggested stronger support from the government, including a preferential loan package with zero percent interest, similar to the one given to Vietnam Airlines.This year, the State Bank of Vietnam (SBV) has provided a refinancing loan of VND4 trillion ($173 million) at zero percent interest for one year to support Vietnam Airlines.The support for aviation businesses is necessary because this is an industry that has the ability to recover quickly when the economy opens and is also a major contributor to the state budget, Ne said.Vietnam Airlines, budget carrier Vietjet Air, the Airports Corporation of Vietnam (ACV), and the Vietnam Air Traffic Management Corporation (VATM) contributed over VND22 trillion in taxes and fees to the state budget in 2019.He said aviation development will spur tourism in particular and the economy as a whole. Some estimates say aviation growth of 2.5 percent will stimulate 1 percent of GDP growth.Nguyen Tuan Anh, head of the central bank’s Credit Department, said that it was planning a VND3 trillion aid package for enterprises.Nguyen Quoc Hung, general secretary of the Vietnam Banks Association, noted that not only airlines but a number of other businesses in the hospitality field were also severely affected by the pandemic and need support.""We should not support some industries while ignoring others as it would create inequality,"" Hung said.The aviation industry has been among the hardest hit by the Covid-19 pandemic. In the first seven months of this year, Vietnamese carriers served 13.7 million passengers, down 32 percent year-on-year, according to the General Statistics Office.","Vietnam,carriers,loan"

business,industries,"Airlines want minimum fares, no one else does","If fares do not make up even the fuel costs of a flight, aviation safety would be affected, Dang Ngoc Hoa, chairman of Vietnam Airlines, said at a meeting held on Monday to get feedback from economists on proposed minimum fares.The Civil Aviation Administration of Vietnam (CAAV) has of VND320,000-VND750,000 ($14.06 - $32.95) for domestic flights between November 1 and October 31 next year to help airlines overcome the difficulties caused by the Covid-19 pandemic.Too low prices would weaken all airlines, Hoa said. Many countries like China and India have floor prices for air tickets, he pointed out.He said amid the pandemic fares are very low at just 40 percent of those in 2018-19, and 250 airplanes are parked in airports, some of which are running out of parking space.But despite the low fares, airlines have to keep operating to maintain parking space, minimum cash flows and planes, he said.During the first Covid outbreak in March 2020, there were three flights a day in total, while during the fourth wave starting in April 2021, especially July-August, ""there were no flights"", he said.All carriers have been hit and most airlines are facing losses, he said.Vietnam Airlines made a loss of VND7 trillion ($301.7 million) in the first half of the year, while private airlines reported losses of a trillion dong, he added.But despite his impassioned argument, economists at the meeting said minimum fares are not acceptable.Can Van Luc, chief economist of BIDV, said floor prices could cause confusion and be unfair to both state-owned and private enterprises, and even violate the Law on Prices and the Law on Enterprises.Nguyen Sy Dung, former deputy head of the Office of the National Assembly, said: ""it is unfair to impose a floor price on air tickets"".If minimum fares are applied, a three-star airline must sell at the same price as a five-star airline, and no customer would spend money to travel in the former, he pointed out.""We might kill an airline through price policy. It's unacceptable"".In a recent communication to the Ministry of Transport, three airlines agreed to apply floor prices airfares while two others disagreed.The Department of Transport admitted that since costs and services are not comparable, it would be difficult to determine common minimum fares applicable to all airlines.In the first seven months of this year Vietnamese carriers carried 13.7 million passengers, down 57.7 percent from the same period in 2019.","Vietnam Airlines,floor prices,airlines"
business,industries,"Vietnam allows fully vaccinated people to produce, deliver agricultural goods","The directive, signed by Deputy Prime Minister Le Van Thanh, aims to promote production and exports in the key agricultural sector amidst the ongoing pandemic.Prime Minister Pham Minh Chinh has asked localities to prioritize vaccination for workers in the agricultural sector and to ensure that pandemic safety measures in safe and low-risk areas are favorable for workers to resume production.Localities should develop production and export plans for agricultural products to avoid disrupting production chains and promote agricultural growth, he said.The ongoing fourth wave of Covid-19 has seriously affected the production, circulation, consumption and export of agricultural products, especially in areas where strict social distancing measures are still in force.Market observers have cautioned that unsold agricultural products and disrupted production chains will hinder supplies in the near future.The export turnover of agriculture, forestry and fisheries products is estimated at $32.1 billion in the first eight months of the year, up 21.6 percent year-on-year, according to the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development.Vietnam has vaccinated nearly 28.7 million people, among them 6.9 million with two doses.","Vietnam,vaccinated persons.

Shippers pay VND75,000 for each test.ShopeeFood has set up medical facilities and supports its delivery people with weekly reward points.Grab too has several reward mechanisms to cover the testing expenses and ensure a minimum income of VND160,000 a day for each driver.Food delivery company Baemin bucks the trend by providing free tests to all its shippers at 13 locations.They receive a QR code confirming their Covid status 60-90 minutes after testing, and it will be valid for three days.The city was providing free testing since allowing inter-district deliveries to resume on Sep. 16.The city will provide the free testing kits until the end of this month.Some delivery people complain that there are too few testing locations for the size of Vietnam’s largest city.Thanh, a driver who lives in Binh Tan District, said some test locations are overloaded due to the large demand.Thien, who lives in Thu Duc City, said: ""I live 12 kilometers away from the nearest testing site. The test and fuel costs are around VND100,000.""Delivery companies said the testing requirements are a big burden for them.Testing a large number of drivers poses challenges in terms of cost and management, ShopeeFood said.AhaMove warned that if it has to bear the testing costs it would have to reduce the number of drivers, causing a shortage and requiring customers to seek expensive non-professional delivery people.It called for increasing the validity of tests, especially for those who have been vaccinated or have had Covid.There are around 92,000 shippers working in HCMC.","Vietnam,shipping,shipper,testing"

business,companies,Rise and fall of two giant companies,"In the early 90s, there was a wave of migration by young people seeking livelihoods from the central Binh Dinh Province to the Central Highlands province of Gia Lai. Two of them, who were working at a handmade wooden furniture business, Doan Nguyen Duc and Bui Phap, set up a private business with a factory, and converted them into two companies named after the province: Hoang Anh Gia Lai, an agricultural firm, and Duc Long Gia Lai, a woodwork producer.Over time both listed on the stock exchange and expanded their business lines and markets.Hoang Anh Gia Lai went into property, energy and agriculture, and rapidly increased its assets. Hospitality, and mining enabled Duc Long Gia Lai to currently grow to more than 830 times since inception.During its golden era Hoang Anh Gia Lai earned profits running into the thousands of billions of dong annually from 2009 to 2011 and ranked among the 30 largest stocks by market capitalization.Duc Long Gia Lai had revenues of VND3 trillion a year from 2016 to 2019.This year both faced a similar problem: being doubted continuously by the auditors for their operation ability and placed on a list of under control stocks by the HCM Stock Exchange (HoSE) for different reasons.Hoang Anh Gia Lai's half-yearly financial statements showed accumulated losses of more than VND7.37 trillion due to switching from property to agriculture, which it sought to lead not only in the country but also the region. The further it went down this path, the more its loans ballooned.In 2016, the company reported its first loss since listing on the stock exchange, and liabilities exceeded VND36 trillion.At one point every VND100 of capital included VND68 worth of bank loans, bonds and the chairman's personal money. A failure to service its debts led to the business being discredited in the eyes of its shareholders and partners.""My company was saved by the government’s policy of extending the bank loan repayment period by five years,"" Doan Nguyen Duc said at an event earlier this year.Duc Long Gia Lai may have had less debts than Hoang Anh Gia Lai, but it still owed VND5.6 trillion, including about VND1.8 trillion in overdue payments.Duc Long Gia Lai's list of creditors includes big banks such as BIDV, Sacombank and Agribank and corporate and personal lenders, and debt interest. Some loans are guaranteed by the chairman Bui Phap and his wife.Most of Duc Long Gia Lai's profits from its core business go toward paying the debts.When queried by suspicious auditors, both companies initially claimed their business situation was stable, and future cash flows could solve their problems.In written explanations, Hoang Anh Gia Lai general director Vo Truong Son and Duc Long Gia Lai general director Tran Cao Van listed possible solutions such as planning a divestment route, liquidating underperforming investments, focusing on debt recovery, and negotiating with lenders.","Vietnam,Hoang Anh Gia Lai,Duc Long Gia Lai,debts"

Most of them are trying to survive here and will leave for their hometowns once restrictions are relaxed,"" said Nguyen Thanh An, chairman of the company’s union labor.The footwear industry in Vietnam has over 1.5 million workers employed by 2,000 companies, and the suspension of over 90 percent of them have sent many to their hometowns, intensifying labor shortages, said Phan Thi Thanh Xuan, deputy chairwoman of the Vietnam Leather, Footwear and Handbag Association (Lefaso).Companies want to bring their workers back but uncertainties about when the economy would fully reopen make them hesitant in signing new contracts, she said.The government should order localities to bring workers back to HCMC, she added.HCMC has 1.2 million factory workers, and 320,000 of them work in industrial parks and manufacturing zones.As of Sep. 1, over 10,600 companies employing nearly 14,000 workers were operating with limited capacity.","Vietnam,Ho Chi Minh City,labor shortage,factories"

Both localities had to shut down many factories to contain the spread of the novel coronavirus.Also, businesses were suffering with the number of firms withdrawing from the market rising nearly 25 percent to over 70,000.""The 5.64 percent growth rate is pretty high and unexpected,"" said Le Duy Binh, CEO of consultancy company Economica Vietnam.But authorities said there was nothing unusual about the growth rate.Le Trung Hieu, head of the National Account System under the General Statistics Office (GSO), said that the rate was high because last year’s level, when Covid-19 first hit Vietnam, was very low.Last year’s H1 growth was 1.82 percent, lowest in nation’s history.Another reason for the high rate is the recovery of the manufacturing and processing sector, Hieu said.Pham Dinh Thuy, head of industrial statistics division under the GSO, said that industrial growth in the first six month grew 9.3 percent year-on-year, only 0.1 percentage point lower than the first half of 2019, when there was no Covid-19 impact.Even Bac Giang, the worst-hit Covid-19 locality, recorded a growth rate of 9 percent, even though without the pandemic, the figure could have been as high as 30-40 percent.Without the fourth Covid-19 wave industrial growth could even have reached 11-12 percent, Hieu said.Some experts said that the growth rate was also supported by growth in exports, services, retail and agriculture.However, the rate was still lower than a prior forecast of 5.8 percent by the Ministry of Planning and Investment, while economists surveyed by  had expected a growth of 7.2 percent in the second quarter alone.To complete the goal of 6 percent growth this year, the country needs a 6.3 percent growth in the second half, Hieu said.""This is a challenging target and it depends on how the Covid-19 pandemic progresses, but Vietnam can make it happen.""However there were other factors of concern, experts said.Binh said that the rising prices of materials, if not managed well, could bring inflationary risks this year and the next.Other concerns are that Vietnam has recorded a trade deficit for two months this year and another one could be coming, and that the unemployment rate has been rising.The country should focus on keeping its macro economy stable and on achieving sustainable growth instead of pursuing GDP targets at all costs, Binh said.","Vietnam,GDP,growth,H1 2021"

Duong Tri Thanh, its CEO, said that the pandemic has set back the aviation industry by three or four years, and has brought down his company’s cash holdings to near zero.Vietnam Airlines Group, consisting of the carrier and its subsidiaries Pacific Airlines and Vietnam Air Services Company (VASCO), posted a loss of VND10.75 trillion ($464 million) for January-September.The number of passengers it served in the period fell by 41 percent to 10.2 million.It has cut sales and management expenses and reduced the salaries of pilots and cabin crew. It has increased the number of repatriation flights bringing Vietnamese nationals home from other countries.But these efforts cannot save the company from suffering one of its worst years in nearly three decades as a commercial airline, with its losses this year forecast to rise to VND15.2 trillion.Budget carrier Vietjet is in a similar situation, with  in the first nine months and the number of flights falling by 43 percent to 58,300.The airline was forced to cut managers’ salaries by half as revenues plunged, and it would take three years for the industry to recover to pre-pandemic levels, a Vietjet spokesperson said in November.In contrast, 2019 saw new carrier Bamboo Airways enter the Vietnamese skies, Vietnam Airlines achieve  and the number of air passengers continue to grow in .The tough times began in March when the government ordered the  to curb the spread of the novel coronavirus and domestic travel demand slumped amid fears of the pandemic.""The impact of Covid-19 has been unprecedented for the aviation industry,"" Dinh Viet Thang, head of the CAAV, told the media in June, pointing out there were times when only 1-2 percent of Vietnam’s 250 aircraft were operating.The second and third quarters were the most challenging period for the industry as a three-week nationwide social distancing campaign in April caused airlines’ revenues to plummet and a second outbreak in July halted their attempts to boost domestic travel and achieve a recovery.Aviation expert Nguyen Thien Tong said it would take at least until 2022 for the industry to recover to pre-pandemic levels because the fear of contagion remains globally.Air travel demand would rise slowly even after Covid-19 is contained globally because many businesspeople have learned to conduct meetings online to keep their companies running during the pandemic and people’s incomes have shrunk, he told .One major factor in any possible recovery will be government support. The National Assembly in November approved a plan for the central bank to and roll over loans. The airline had earlier asked for a relief package of VND12 trillion.Lawmakers also  by 30 percent from August this year until the end of next year.Tong said: ""More low-interest loans should be given to airlines based on how much tax they have contributed in recent years, not how much ownership the government has in them.""The tourism industry needs to offer more promotionsto foster domestic aviation since it is unclear when regular international flights would resume, he said.The newly licensed Vietravel Airlines should wait until the market recovers in 2022 before it begins flying since its entry would only worsen things for existing airlines, he added.","Vietnam,aviation,2020,airlines"

business,data-speaks,Vietnam growth to hit decades high 8.6 pct: Fitch Solutions,"The firm revised the growth rate, the highest in 24 years according to World Bank’s data, from the earlier 8.2 percent, expecting a global vaccine rollout to drive recovery in external demand for Vietnamese exports and also bring about regional travel bubbles to jump start inbound tourism.Growth will be driven by industrial production and construction, supported by growing external demand following the commencement of the EU-Vietnam Free Trade Agreement (EVFTA) and the Vietnam-U.K. Free Trade Agreement (UKVFTA) last year, Fitch Solutions said in a report.The UKVFTA would position Vietnam as a key country to source lower value added goods and agriculture goods from Asia in the coming years, considering that the U.K.’s other existing arrangements in the region are with more developed countries specializing in higher value-added products.There is large scope for growth in Vietnamese exports in the years to come as the country has been a major beneficiary of the supply chain relocation trend out of China, the report notes.Effective containment of Covid-19 in Vietnam would also allow for smoother progress of private construction projects in housing and commercial real estate, as well as key public projects like the Eastern North-South Expressway and Long Thanh International Airport.The services sector, which saw demand plunge last year due to the pandemic, is set to benefit from Vietnam’s ongoing economic recovery combined with a good likelihood for its involvement in regional leisure travel bubbles in 2021 considering progress seen in the ongoing global Covid-19 vaccine rollout.Financial services will likely also continue registering stronger growth over the coming quarters as an improving economic outlook spurs an increase in credit demand, supported by low interest rates.""We expect 2021 to herald a year of economic recovery around the world, which should support external demand for Vietnamese exports,"" the report says.Vietnam’s GDP growth was 2.9 percent last year, lowest in 2011-2020, but still among a small number of countries with positive growth at a time the pandemic has sent major economies into contraction.","Vietnam,GDP,Fitch Solutions"

business,data-speaks,Vietnam among world’s fastest growing economies in 2020,"The country will be one of only three nations in Asia that will post positive growth this year, the others being China and Myanmar, according to a World Bank report.Other economies will contract, with major Southeast Asian economies like Thailand and the Philippines likely to shrink by 7.1 percent and 8.3 percent respectively.Although its 2.8 percent growth is lower than last year’s over 7 percent, Vietnam is still a bright spot as the global economy is set to contract 4.4 percent, the report says.Vietnam has been able to achieve this positive growth thanks to early, effective efforts to contain the Covid-19 outbreaks. After three weeks of a national lockdown in April, most industrial and service activities rebounded as domestic consumers and investors regained confidence.The government’s acceleration of public investment disbursement, which increased by about 40 percent in the first nine months compared to the same period last year, helped support affected businesses and people, the report said.""The strong management of the Covid-19 crisis has been Vietnam’s best promotional tool, encouraging foreign companies to reallocate their production activities to Vietnam from other countries where their factories are still closed, thus contributing to the country’s robust export performance.""However, Vietnam is still exposed to risks from the pandemic. The increased spending and reduced revenue in the pandemic’s wake has resulted in the government foregoing about $1 billion per month during the second and third quarter this year, the report said.If such an accommodative policy were to be sustained over a long period, the government would need to identify new sources of funding that would require substantial reforms in the areas of public financial management, tax collection and debt, it added.The banking sector is set to see an increasing number of borrowers gradually default on their debt, raising the proportion of problematic loans.Because Vietnam has one of the highest levels of banking credit relative to GDP in the world, close attention should be paid to the risks involved, it added.About one-third of households saw their income decline between July and August, and the government should pay immediate attention to these victims who are generally not covered by existing social programs and are in danger of being left behind, it said.The World Bank forecasts Vietnam’s economy to grow by about 6.8 percent next year, assuming that the Covid-19 pandemic will be gradually brought under control.","Vietnam,World Bank,GDP,growth"

Tan Dinh’s main points of interest are found along Hai Ba Trung and Tran Quang Khai streets but its network of side-streets and alleyways are worth exploring too. Here’s a collection of different delights to enjoy in Tan Dinh. Hai Ba Trung Street’s lower half dissects downtown District 1, but its upper section, Tan Dinh’s main north-south axis and its westernmost boundary, presents a completely different vibe. Named after national heroines, the Trung sisters, this extensive street that is lined with lurid neon-lit signs offers some alternative retail therapy. Inexplicably, wall-to-wall pharmacies with streetside open counters (the go-to hotspot for Covid-19 face masks), numerous Christmas pop-up stalls that magically appear late November, specializing in flashing Santa’s and sparkly tinsel and an almost identical run of brightly-lit fabric stores co-exist in a chaotic harmony. There are also several home-grown fashion boutiques, where, if you’re aged under 25, blessed with snake hips and can stand ear-splitting techno music, you can snap up bargain-priced attire.Named after a 13th century royal general, Tran Quang Khai is Tan Dinh’s main east-west axis, a picturesque, broad street lined with towering old tree. It is said that this part of Tan Dinh was a former Chinese ghetto and telltale vestiges remain, including numerous buildings marked with Chinese characters. And this is not to mention several old-school Chinese noodle shops and authentic, no-frills ‘Chinese takeaway’ joints where roasted glazed ducks, chicken and pork hang from window hooks. Worth particular mention are Huynh Ky (#2Bis), operating for 70 plus years, along with its larger neighbor, the Thanh Xuan restaurant, on Dinh Tien Hoang Street. Other marked notables include a pastel hued colonial era villa ( #17) with entrance gates bearing bright yin-yang symbols and a handful of 20th century Dinhs (community houses-temples, honoring heroes and founding patrons), boldly decorated in gold and red. The most noteworthy of these are Dinh Nam Chon and Dinh Phu Hoa, richly ornamented both inside and out. On nearby Tran Khac Chan Street, there’s even a Hong Kong-style tea house, emblazoned with striking ‘Ancient China’-themed wall murals. Built over a century ago, the Nam Chon Temple (Dinh Nam Chon) at #29 Tran Quang Khai is officially recognized as a municipal cultural relic. Having undergone extensive renovations, this striking temple has been restored to its former glory with distinctive roof-edge detail, tiger bas-relief at the entrance and interiors adorned with carved unicorns and dragons. Over the last few decades, Nam Chon has also evolved as an important Vietnamese martial arts center in HCMC – the Nam Huynh Dao Kung Fu School. Originally founded in northern Vietnam centuries ago, with nowadays, thousands of disciples nationwide, this Vietnamese traditional martial arts differs from its Chinese counterpart, incorporating physical training, Kung Fu techniques, a philosophy of wellbeing and strong community spirit. Around four times daily, from dawn to dusk, local disciples as young as five practice Vietnamese Nam Huynh Dao together in the streetside courtyard. Watching the group going through their martial arts positions and techniques– from serene breathing exercises to jumping high kicks – instructed by experts is a memorable experience. At 289 Hai Ba Trung, the Tan Dinh Catholic Church officially stands in District 3. Its name refers to the Tan Dinh parish just across the street that it serves. It is the neighborhood’s most recognizable landmark and reference point – a frothy pink towering church resembling something from a fairy-tale. After iconic Notre Dame Cathedral, Tan Dinh is HCMC’s second largest church and inaugurated in 1876, one of its oldest.Along with the unusual pink hue, the Tan Dinh Church ranks as one of HCMC's most striking buildings for its unique fusion of Gothic, Romanesque and Baroque architectural features. A lesser known understudy to popular tourist haunt, the iconic Ben Thanh Market, the Tan Dinh Market (338-310 Hai Ba Trung) is equally historic and fascinating. In the late 19th century, this was one of the city’s most important markets. Its present day building, constructed by the French in the 1920s, presents a classic colonial architectural style and ‘three steeples’ façade – albeit its endearingly rundown state. Tan Dinh provides a more genuine local market experience and with relatively few tourists, is free of souvenir stalls, overpriced items and hassling of buyers. Vendors are generally an amiable bunch.Foodstuff and fabric are the main specialties, but locals also gravitate here for a range of commodities including household goods and kitchenware, readymade clothes, footwear, toys, cosmetics and jewellery. Tan Dinh boasts some of the city’s most authentic street food with diverse cuisines - Saigonese, regional and Chinese-influenced fare. There are too many good establishments to mention, although the following are noteworthy. English isn’t spoken much; just point and order!The food stalls along Nguyen Huu Cau Street, backing onto Tan Dinh Market are renowned for their inexpensive, tasty Vietnamese dishes, fromSaigon’s signature dish  (noodle soup with crab paste) to  (sweet soup dessert). Once the market shuts, Com Tam Di Tam, nearby, at 319 Hai Ba Trung, is popular for another Saigonese delicacy, ‘ broken rice’ with grilled pork. This is one of HCMC’s oldest broken rice stalls. A beloved Saigon institution since 1941, Banh Xeo (46A Dinh Cong Trang) is hugely popular. The house specialty, , is one of southern Vietnam’s most celebrated dishes: crêpes made of rice flour, turmeric and coconut milk, with pork belly slivers, shrimps, spring onions and bean sprouts, folded over and pan-fried to a crispy, golden brown ‘shell.’ Tan Dinh got a Hollywood boost more than a decade ago when Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie had dinner at the acclaimed Cuc Gach Quan in 2010. Hidden behind high wooden doors at #10 Dang Tat Street, Cuc Gach Quan is housed in a cavernous mansion resembling a northern Vietnamese countryside home.This informal yet upscale restaurant is favored by locals and visitors for traditional Vietnamese home-cooked fare with a southern focus, many made with organic produce sourced from their own farm. Across Vietnam, countless streets and
statues honor Tran Hung Dao, one of Vietnam’s greatest national
heroes who
thwarted Mongol invaders in the 13th century. A temple dedicated to Tran Hung
Dao at 36 Vo Thi Sau Street, is the biggest one dedicated the national hero in
southern Vietnam. Designed in northern Vietnamese traditional style, even after numerous restorations, it still bears the original T-shape and piled roofs, and impressive golden dragons, tigers and phoenix decorations. A statue of Tran Hung Dao dominates the front courtyard, with a series of reliefs depicting his legendary military successes. Richly ornamented interiors feature striking lacquered poem boards, silk parasols and intricately carved altars. With few visitors, this temple is generally a peaceful oasis except on full moon days and the annual festival, Gio Ong, when local devotees flock here for special celebrations. Cafés are some of the city’s greatest drawcards and Tan Dinh is no exception, hosting some gems. Cộng Ca Phe at 274 Hai Ba Trung is one of many nationwide branches that feature a trademark retro-vintage theme, serving addictive coconut milk iced coffees in a quirky ambiance. The upper-floor terrace provides great views of the Tan Dinh Church, making it an Instagram hotspot. With its stylish North European-influenced decor and cold brew coffees, Cokernut Café (14 Tran Nhat Duat) almost seems too hip for this very ‘local’ street. Besides these, several atmospheric cafés are strung along leafy Hoang Sa and Nhieu Loc-Thi Nghe Canal. Owned by an artist, Chieu Café (377) evokes a Parisian-style pavement café, with an indoor salon filled with artworks and second-hand books, while at #355, Ca Phe Trung 3T comes housed in a rustic-style, timbered building, where the first-floor balcony reveals canal views through the treetops. Its name originates in the signature drink – hot egg coffee. At 247 Hoang Sa, the Van Tho Pagoda (Chua Van Tho Co Tu) is an unexpected yet spectacular sight along this waterfront suburb: a cluster of vaulted, whimsically ornate and Chinese-influenced towers and pillars rise from a high-walled compound – including a giant laughing Buddha elevated in his own tower. Dimly-lit, cavernous interiors reveal an evocative main hall with the Buddha taking centerstage and a vast funerary vault, notably in the solemn upper chambers, crammed with memorial tablets and ceramic urns. Also known as ‘Longevity Temple,’ this early 20th-century pagoda operates a free medical clinic for the poor.

Opening from 6 to 10 a.m. it sells out roughly 50 kilograms of noodles a day.Di Canh crab noodle soup eatery is in Alley 4 (now 23/6), Ba Trieu Street, Ward 1, Da Lat.The crab noodle soup at Di Canh keeps customers coming back because of its unique and intense flavor that is very different from the traditional one in the north.Field crab is pounded and mixed with dried shrimp and meat and then layered onto rice noodles. A generous serving of crab roe completes the dish, adding depth to the sweet tomato soup.Customers say even after they finish the noodles chunks of roe remain. They even half-jokingly ask how the eatery is making a profit from such generous portions.The owner and staff at Di Canh are friendly. Photo by VnExpress/Trung Nghia.Served on the side is thinly sliced chili, green chili, chili powder, sate (lemongrass chili oil), and a chili garlic vinegar sauce. The spiciness of the chili complements the dish and warms up the body on cool days in the hill town.The eatery also serves a homemade aloe vera drink that is very refreshing.A hearty bowl of crab noodle soup costs VND25,000-35,000 ($1.1-1.5).","Da Lat,cuisine,crab noodle soup,Di Canh"

life,fearful-and-hoping-against-hope-hanoians-in-crumbling-apartments-4387477.html,Fearful and hoping against hope: Hanoians in crumbling apartments,"Nguyen Van Thu doesn't plan to move out of his 30-square-meter home, an apartment on the third floor of the old residential quarters C8 Giang Vo in Ba Dinh District anytime soon even though it was classified as dangerous and unsafe eight years ago.He was given the property in 1983. Thu and his wife, two children, and an older sister live there.Nguyen Van Thu's eight-square-meter living room in a crumbling Hanoi apartment. Photo by VnExpress/Pham ChieuThe apartment has two bedrooms, each with an area of around 10 square meters, and a living room with a TV, a table, some chairs and a sewing machine. Everything is pushed back against the walls, which are moldy and have green moss, to create an empty space in the middle where the family normally dine, study, sew and do other things.A washing machine, an induction cooker, sink and dish drying rack are placed by the entrance, leaving a narrow 70 centimeter passage that will make two people have to squeeze each other when passing through.For many years now, the purchase of a new appliance or replacing an old one gets the whole family to think hard about where to put them.Thu, a Hanoi native, is very reluctant to invite relatives and friends over, fearing ""bad press"" for his downgraded house. His family and the neighbors usually hang out in the front corridor to enjoy some fresh air. They are tired of the moldy walls that are in very bad shape.The passage inside Thu's home is narrowed by home appliances. Photo by VnExpress/Pham ChieuSince it is dangerous for residents, local officials have used iron bars to set up temporary barricades in the dilapidated balconies and placed some against the stairways to provide some strength and support.The five-storied C8 Giang Vo apartment complex was built in 1979. With each apartment having area of just 30 square meters, many occupants have installed burglar bars outside to expand their space.In 2013, the Institute of Science and Technology and Economy Construction Hanoi inspected the quality of the complex and classified it as unsafe. It urged all residents to evacuate immediately.The following year, the then Hanoi Chairman, Nguyen The Thao, arranged for the relocation of families living in the building in September.Residents were to be provided temporary accommodation for resettlement on Trung Hoa Street, Cau Giay District, and each family would receive financial support of VND6 million (around $265) each month.However, according to the Hanoi Department of Construction, 18 out of 36 households still live in the C8 Giang Vo apartment as of July this year. Thu's family is one of them.""I would be lying if I say I'm not afraid. But relocating to a temporary home is very inconvenient. All our legal documents are registered at this address and it is more convenient for my children to go to school from here.""We do want the new building to be quickly constructed. But we don't know when or how long it will take. If we move out now, will it be done in 10 or 15 years from now? How can we be sure?""A corridor in the C8 Giang Vo apartment building is moldy and has many cracks. Photo by VnExpress/Pham ChieuIn 2016, the complex’s residents had a meeting with the authorities and nearly 90 percent of people voted yes to build a new apartment on the plot of land and agreed on the contractors to be appointed.Thu thought then to himself that the newly built 60 square meter home would help his children "" confidently invite friends over to play"" and give family members a more spacious place to live.But the plan has not been implemented so far.Now the apartment’s condition has worsened and Thu does not want to repair it. It would also be very inconvenient to move things inside his narrow apartment.""We will not leave until we see the construction unit bring the construction materials and machines here.""Nguyen Thi Ngan’s family were also residents of C8 Giang Vo. They moved to the temporary accommodation in 2016, but moved out after five months. She said that even though the new place was quite comfortable, it was very far from the schools of her two children.Since local authorities locked and blocked the entrance to her apartment after she relocated, Ngan couldn't move back in. So she rented a room nearby.""I sell refreshments on the street right opposite my old apartment. This helps me keep a watch on my property,"" she said.Ngan revealed that her apartment was just 18-square-meters, so when the city introduced a policy to renovate the apartment building, she was not interested at first.""They wanted to make each apartment have an area of 70 square meters, which meant I would have to spend more money in order to continue living here. I just sell refreshments and struggle to make ends meet already, how would I be able to buy a new, bigger apartment?""About five kilometers away, another apartment complex, H1 Nguyen Cong Tru on Pho Hue Street, Hai Ba Trung District, built in the 1960s, is also in bad shape.During the rainy season, rainwater from the fourth floor flows down to the first floor. Outside, the paint has been peeling off in large patches.Le Thi Thuy, whose house is on the fourth floor, said that she entire ceiling in the corridor is damaged and roof tiles are also broken.""I, like dozens of families living here, live in fear, always worried about the possibility of collapse,"" Thuy said.The damaged ceiling and roof tiles inside the corridor of the H1 Nguyen Cong Tru apartment building.

Of these, 179 are classified as ""dangerous"" or ""severely damaged."" Most were built between 1960 and 1994, and some before 1954, when Vietnam achieved independence from the French.These apartments are severely degraded and get flooded often. They also have a poor fire protection system and no parking space.A renovation plan was set out by Hanoi more than 20 years ago with the goal of taking down all the old apartments by 2015. However, only 19 apartments have been upgraded or rebuilt and work is going on at 14 others.Five years ago, 19 investors registered to study renovate 30 apartment buildings. So far, things have only gotten as far as the first and second blueprints. Some enterprises have also withdrawn from the renovation project.There have been many other meetings on this issue since, but no significant change has happened.Dang Hung Vo, Former Deputy Minister of Natural Resources and Environment, said that at current pace, Hanoi will have to renovate both old and new apartments at the same time because the latter would have become old then.Most recently, this September, the Hanoi People's Council approved a resolution on the project to renovate and rebuild the old apartment buildings. In the 2021-2025 five-year period, the city plans to urgently relocate households and renovate 10 old apartment buildings that are on the verge of collapse.His apartment building is on the list.

life,culture,Filmmakers 'work in the field of culture but go against culture',"A film crew making 'Chuyen Lang Bom' (Bom Village’s Story) recently painted white an ancient well in Hanoi’s Mong Phu Village. Earlier, those making 'Thai Su Tran Thu Tho' (Great Tutor Tran Thu Do) shocked many by moving the altar of Emperor Minh Mang while filming. Painter Truong Duc Thang, a member of the ""Chuyen Lang Bom"" crew, was fined VND2 million ($88.39) on Nov. 10 for writing, drawing and desecrating a historical-cultural monument.Nguyen Van Huy, former director of the Hanoi-based Museum of Ethnology, said that such actions were an infringement on historical relics and monuments.""They work in the field of culture but go against culture. The act of renewing the ancient relic, making it mossy to film a movie is ridiculous.""""The Duong Lam ancient village has been ranked a national historical monument for a long time. It is unacceptable to film there without respecting it. Those making art but have no understanding of it should be severely punished,"" a reader commented.The ancient well in Mong Phu Village is painted and decorated by the crew of 'Chuyen Lang Bom.' Photo by Do Doan HoangIn 2010, when filming 'Thai Su Tran Thu Do' at Emperor Minh Mang’s Tomb located in the complex of Hue monuments, the film crew moved all the altars of the king and his family to the corner of the hall, making room for the king and queen's bedroom in a movie scene. The main hall was also full of electric wires, lamp posts, tables and chairs, clothes, personal belongings... of the film crew. The team had to clean up and rearrange the main hall to its original state later. The Co Loa Citadel in Hanoi was also painted by a film crew.Such actions by crews looking to create film sets to match their stories have angered many.Tran Dinh Thanh, Deputy Director of the Cultural Heritage Department under the Ministry of Culture, Sports and Tourism, said while such actions were rare, recent incidents were a reminder for filmmakers to be more careful.Putting a positive spin on it, he said the public concern shows that awareness of cultural heritage protection has significantly improved.Thanh said movies and TV shows set in historical sites help promote their cultural values to the public. Therefore, authorities need to encourage and facilitate this. But in order to limit mistakes, film crews must contact the management board and local authorities to ask for permission and present the content of the works before they do it. They must also comply with the regulations, carefully study the monuments to know the do's and don'ts and comply accordingly.Management boards must also guide and supervise the crew throughout the filmmaking process, he added.""The two sides must coordinate to minimize unnecessary incidents, anticipate negative impacts on our heritage, and take measures to prevent and adjust films’ content based on the principles of heritage preservation.""'Gai Gia Lam Chieu 5' is filmed in An Dinh Palace in the ancient capital of Hue. Photo courtesy of 'Gai Gia Lam Chieu 5'Many film crews have said that they were careful when filming amidst cultural and historical monuments.The movie 'Gai Gia Lam Chieu 5' (Camellia Sisters) is set in the ancient capital of Hue. Director Namcito proposed using the An Dinh Palace as the main set for the film to the People's Committee of Thua Thien Hue Province and other concerned departments a year before shooting.The team had to present plans to maintain the palace’s status quo. After obtaining approval, they had to sign a commitment not to touch the wall, scratch the floor, damage the glass door and so on.Namcito said: ""Besides upholstering the edges of chairs and tables, hanging pictures without sticking them to the wall, hanging curtains without nails, we made warning signs and instructed staff to avoid contact with antiques.""In order to move the artifacts or change any detail, they had to make a written request to the management board. Scenes were filmed during the hot summer season in Hue and the crew had to install air conditioners that did not touch the palace’s walls.Actor Vuong Rau said that because he regularly performs comedy shows in ancient villages and historical sites, he had to ask for permission from the authorities first.During the filming process, he and his crew were careful not to change anything from the original. They also reminded each other to be careful with words and actions. ""Creating good or bad artworks is another story, but destroying heritage is terrible,"" he said.Many countries have enacted regulations to ensure that filming does not affect historical sites.According to Chinese news site Sina, some localities in China have had their relics and antiques damaged during filming. Therefore, since 2000, many have issued their own regulations to protect their heritage.For scenes that are shot for films such as the Forbidden City, companies in China build monumental film sets, recreating palaces and other structures to serve filmmakers and tourists.The Heng Dian World Studio in Zhejiang Province - a complex that serves many functions including filming, tourism, and relaxation, is one such film set. From 1996 until now, the Heng Dian Group has invested more than $425 million to build Hong Kong Street, palaces of the Qing and Ming Dynasties, Palaces of Qin Dynasty, etc. for filming and tourism. Thousands of movies and TV series have been filmed here, including many famous works.In Beijing, an $850 million studio in Huairou has similarly attracted many filmmakers.In the U.K., filmmakers hire supervisors to advise and monitor filming activities to avoid damaging any historical or cultural vestige. According to the British Institute of Conservation, all concerned parties need to sign a contract and discuss the footage thoroughly. The person in charge of the scene has to submit a proposal that includes the aims of the crew, risk assessments and safe filming methods.The conservation unit needs to know if the recording content is suitable for the relic site or not, to avoid filming ""hot"" and violent scenes in inappropriate places. The contract must be agreed and signed by both parties before shooting.The James Bond film crew is famous for choosing historical settings for filming without causing damage to buildings and monuments. In ""No Time To Die"", the team went to the ancient city of Matera in Italy to shoot many action scenes. Chris Corbould - responsible for the technical effects of the project - said the team organized 14 trips before the place was chosen. To protect the ancient structures of the city, they wrapped buildings with special materials and decorated them like real walls.

It takes us hundreds of years to build and preserve ancient relics, but they can be easily demolished in a moment.""","movie,film,cinema,culture,moviemaker"
life,pets-turn-pet-interest-in-cities-amid-pandemic-4393390.html,Pets turn pet interest in cities amid pandemic,"The report, which analyzed Google searches for pets in Southeast Asian countries, said the pandemic seemed to have sparked great interest in buying pets in the region.There were 1.9 million searches for pets in Vietnam in the first nine months of the year, up from 1.7 million and 1.4 million during the same period in 2019 and 2018, respectively.Vietnam was second after the Philippines, which had nearly 7 million searches in the first nine months.In Southeast Asia as a whole, the number of searches for pets and pet-related terms on Google in the region reached 12.9 million in the first nine months of this year, an increase of 88 percent year-on-year.iPrice found that there was a higher demand for dog ownership in the region, when the interest in dogs was five times more than in cats. In Vietnam, the interest in dogs was 5.7 times higher.The report noted that there was a strong correlation between the demand for pets and the severity of the pandemic and travel restrictions.Yen Nhi in HCMC's Binh Thanh District bought a hybrid Russian cat with blue eyes and white fur named Milk in May, around the time the fourth Covid-19 wave struck Vietnam.Milk, a cat bought by HCMC resident Yen Nhi during the recent lockdown. Photo courtesy of NhiNhi said buying the cat was the correct decision. ""I think investing in pets is worth it. Having a cat during the social distancing period made me feel less lonely.""The report said that the fight against the virus was not over in the region, so one of the ways in which people were looking for relief from mental stress was to spend time and money on a beloved pet.This has seen demand for pet-related products rise strongly. In fact, the market research firm said that Vietnam’s impression on pet supplies surged by 220 percent this year, higher than the Philippines at 145 percent.Some dog and cat owners said that the increased demand was also due to the mentality of hoarding pet food, just in case the supply from abroad was interrupted by the pandemic.Yen Nhi said that since she got her cat, she was spending about VND1 million ($43.96) each month on cat food like pate and treats, litter box and toys. A medical exam and vaccination costs about VND500,000.Nguyen Phuong from Hanoi's Cau Giay District, the owner of a gray British cat nearly 2 years old, spent more than VND2 million on an automatic feeding machine a few months ago to ensure that her cat was fed in case she ended up testing positive and going into isolation.""I also store more food and sand. For example, instead of buying only one bag of cat food at a time, I purchase two. In June, the price for cat food at my local pet store increased 5-10 percent due to scarcity,"" she said.Moc Mien in HCMC's Binh Chanh District owns an Akita dog named Hachi. She said the cost of raising her dog has skyrocketed in the past four months, having to have dry food, treats, anti-mites medicine and other products delivered after the city imposed its stay-at-home order.Hachi, an Akita owned by HCMC resident Moc Mien.

Without Hachi, the four-month lockdown would have had negative psychological effects.""Google impressions on the pet supplies category in the first 10 months this year increased by 158 percent against the same period last year across Southeast Asia, with Thailand posting the highest increase of 350 percent.","Vietnam,pet,pet owner,pandemic,lockdown,stay-at-home order"

life,hanoi-s-latest-quarantine-rules-frustrate-visitors-from-high-risk-areas-4387198.html,Hanoi’s latest quarantine rules frustrate visitors from high-risk areas,"28-year-old The Minh is a Hanoi resident who works in HCMC. He finds the new mandate, signed Tuesday and taking effect Wednesday, unnecessary.Minh had planned to fly to Hanoi early next month for an important interview but has had to reschedule his flight to arrive one week earlier, which cost him an extra VND2 million ($89).""I have to cancel all of my plans with business partners and friends next week,"" Minh complained. ""I’m trying very hard to finish my work before my flight now.""Minh, who has been fully vaccinated and has strictly obeyed Vietnam’s five safety rules, thinks two rounds of rapid testing, before and after flight, would be enough to contain the risks. He has also bought a quick test kit for use at home to ensure he isn’t infected before a flight.For fully vaccinated or Covid recovered travelers from high-risk cities and provinces like HCMC, Binh Duong, Long An and Dong Nai, Hanoi mandates one week’s self-quarantine, plus two rounds of testing, once on the first day of arrival, and then on the 7th day.Those from high-risk areas who aren’t fully vaccinated will have to undergo two tests, one week in self-quarantine, and another week of careful self-monitoring with observance of five safety rules: masking, disinfection, maintaining distance, avoiding gatherings and making health declaration.From safer, lower-risk areas, fully vaccinated travelers have to self-quarantine for one week, have one test done on the first day of arrival. Those who aren’t fully vaccinated will have to self-quarantine for one week, self-monitor for another week, and undergo two rounds of testing.As for the latest mandate, which was issued at too short a notice for many travelers to adjust their travel plans, some doctors have said that with the population vaccinated to a certain extent, obeying the five safety rules is more important than such self-quarantine which may or may not help to reduce infection risks and will negatively affect economic development.Nguyen Huy Nga, former head of the General Department of Preventive Medicine, said that Hanoi’s latest regulation was not in line with the government’s policy to ensure smooth travel and facilitate economic recovery.""As the capital of the country Hanoi attracts a lot of people coming to do business. The seven-day isolation policy will affect economic recovery.""Nga said that only people returning from Level 4 areas (those with high contagion risk) should be asked to isolate themselves upon returning to the city.Van Khoi's air ticket to Hanoi on Dec. 2, 2021. Photo courtesy of KhoiDr. Tran Si Tuan also disagrees with the regulation. Many people only want to travel to Hanoi in 1-2 days for business. The mandated seven-day quarantine would ""discourage them"" and they would no longer want to go to the capital city anymore, he said.Tuan proposed that Hanoi requires fully vaccinated visitors to scan QR codes upon their arrival or at certain locations to facilitate contact tracing when necessary. ""Pandemic prevention measures must ensure public safety without hindering socio-economic development and people’s travel needs,"" he noted.27-year-old Van Khoi, an office employee in HCMC, will also fly to Hanoi early next month. Khoi said initially he intended to stay with a friend, but had had to change his plan and spend more money by booking a room for one week of self-isolation at a hotel.Khoi had also taken extra precautions by booking more expensive flight tickets that allow him to reschedule flexibly, in case Hanoi changes its mind or the pandemic in HCMC takes a wrong turn.Khoi said staying indoors during self-quarantine wasn’t a problem because he could still work online.But he has had to constantly update himself with the latest safety rules. ""What I fear most is that in the next few days, Hanoi will apply general quarantine to all travelers from HCMC,"" he said.","Vietnam,Covid-19,flight,Hanoi,HCMC,quarantine rule,self-isolation mandate"

Photo by NovartisThe workshop also emphasized the effects of heart failure among patients during the pandemic since the disease falls among one of 20 groups of comorbidities, in order to reduce the risk of death when patients are co-infected with Covid-19.According to Assoc. Prof. Nguyen Ngoc Quang, deputy director of the National Heart Institute, heart failure is a global health problem with a high incidence. As many as 1-2 percent of the population in developed countries suffer heart failure, while one in every five people over 40 years old will develop the disease. Although Vietnam has no official statistics on the number of heart failure patients, it is estimated that 320,000 to 1.6 million people living with the disease need treatment.Contributing to comprehensive management in reducing the rate of hospitalization, the European Society of Cardiology (ESC)/American Health Association (AHA) is implementing a new heart failure management model at more than 40 hospitals in Vietnam, gradually demonstrating its effectiveness.Assoc. Prof. Nguyen Ngoc Quang, deputy director of the National Heart Institute, talks about the effective of ARNI on heart failure. Photo by NorvatisARNI is recommended for patients with chronic heart failure in many international and Vietnamese guidelines on the diagnosis and treatment of the disease. Creating favorable conditions for heart failure patients to access and use effective medications like ARNI will help prevent hospitalization, discharge, re-hospitalization and the risk of mortality.Roeland Roelofs, Global Cardio Metabolic head, Novartis Switzerland also shared his international experience on solutions to reduce avoidable hospitalization for heart failure patients with multi-dimensional management mechanisms from developed countries, including advanced innovations, clinical expertise, health financing/payment solutions, patient management, and outpatient monitoring.Rachel O'Neale, head of Country Pharmaceutical Organization, Novartis Vietnam, said: ""I believe the avoidance of unreasonable hospitalization and improvement of treatment quality plays a critical role. It would help not only enhance efficiency of the healthcare system but also control the pandemic in the long run, and save as many lives as possible, especially patients with co-morbidities and chronic diseases like heart failure.""As a leading global pharmaceutical company, Novartis uses innovative science and digital technologies to create transformative treatments in areas of great medical need, aiming to improve and extend lives. The company ranks among the world’s top firms investing in research and development.In early 2020, Novartis Vietnam Ltd. transformed from a multinational pharmaceutical company to a foreign-invested enterprise, fully operationalizing its import activities.

The Covid-19 pandemic brought in an unprecedented close-down with uncertainty and anxiety,"" McClaran said.In education specifically, teachers and students have had a difficult time adjusting to the ""new normal"" where all teaching and learning takes place at home. Making matters worse was the fact that many international students and staff were stuck and could not return to their homeland.McClaran said he himself faced challenges when he returned from Australia to the U.K. to take up a new assignment at St Mary's University right in the middle of the pandemic. He had to find a way to connect and work with his team without being able to meet them in person.Professor McClaran, currently President of GuildHE, an organization representing more than 50 universities in the U.K. Photo by Swinburne Vietnam University""It was almost 20 months of working without seeing each other. In the beginning, instead of making long-term plans, we switched to making short and extremely short plans to overcome the crisis while ensuring that we do not lose sight of our long-term goals,"" he said.Determining what needed to be delivered to students and understanding how they were responding to the new learning circumstances were part of the new challenges posed by the pandemic. One long term implication of the current situation is that online higher education will play increasingly important roles in the future, McClaran said, adding that prioritizing resources would present another major challenge.""We worked out a strategy called digital growth, looking into how many learning resources we could deliver and how we could improve online experiences provided to students.""On the subject of ""changemakers,"" he said self-recovery would be a necessary skill. The development of ""changemakers"" requires universities to accord top priority to mental health, he stressed.Covid brings in a lot of uncertainties and anxieties for everyone, including doubts about whether they would be able to see loved ones again, when to return to their homeland, and how to protect themselves from the risk of infection, he explained.Highlighting his personal experience, he said he and his team held dozens of meetings on Zoom every day. The goal was to teach people how to take care of their physical and mental health and provide adequate support so they would not feel alone.The pandemic has also placed demands on new skills, including empathy and sensitivity to interact and work with people in different positions.""At the societal level, the pandemic also forces us to re-evaluate what is important, paying more attention to the sacrifices and contributions of others and recognizing the travails of the disadvantaged sections of society,"" he said.Reverting again to his personal experience, he noted: ""As the situation was looking more optimistic and some students started returning to campus, we introduced the concept of 'flexible' working. This means allowing people to decide and sign up for when to work on campus and when to work from home. We also set up a support hotline for both students and faculty to help them cope with pressure.""He said that his team placed great emphasis on volunteer work, encouraging students to step outside of their own concerns and help others.On the need to adapt to the fast changing situation, McClaran said it was important to take advantage of the rapid growth in online learning and use of advanced technology. Even after the crisis is over, people would have to remain flexible about studying or work remotely ""because we will have many more crises to face in the future.""McClaran said students were the main inspiration for him and his associates in becoming and developing ""changemakers.""In the past year, the youth have displayed extraordinary energy and spirit in facing the many challenges to their mental health, he noted.He said his team at St Mary's University had held a graduation for their students this July. It was a memorable occasion that showcased everyone's eagerness ""to be together again.""The professor reminded future ""changemakers"" that they should choose what they are passionate about, and imagine the extraordinary changes that can happen when they take action.","Education,Swinburne Vietnam,pandemic times"

Photo courtesy of Bonhams""Despite a restrictive lacquer palette, Hau masterfully created various shades of gold, brown, vermillion, amber and red, demonstrating the limitless power of lacquer in depicting our colorful world.""The painting was given toPulitzer Prize-winning American Journalist Edgar Ansel Mowrer (1892-1977) in 1951, when he paid a visit to Vietnam. His trip culminated in an appointment with Bao Dai in the Central Highlands Town of Da Lat.It is known that Bao Dai had ordered paintings and screens from Pham Hau, both for his personal collection and as official gifts to statesmen and politicians. Mowrer brought the six-panel painting back to his family home in New Hampshire, where it was hung and admired for decades before passing down by descent to the present owner. The family has also kept a calling card from Bao Dai, which will be part of the lot on offer.The upcoming auction will also include a painting from Mai Trung Thu.Hau (1903 - 1995) created a range of famous works. He demonstrated a profound grasp of both eastern and western artistic principles and philosophies through his paintings, while his poetic landscape compositions ""offer us a glimpse into the rich and complex Vietnamese culture"", said the auction house.In June, his lacquer painting ‘Thac Bo’ (Landscapes with Junks) was  ($1 million) by French auction house Aguttes.","painting,Vietnamese painting,auction,fine art,art"
life,asexuals-people-s-honest-stories-about-dating-4383251.html,Asexuals people’s honest stories about dating,"Ha Anh, 35, a translator, once posted a message on a dating app that she was looking for someone five to 10 years younger who would be her ""life partner without sex"".An asexual, she had dated two men in the past, the first time when she was in college, a long-distance relationship that lasted nearly four years. Her heart used to flutter when she was with her boyfriend, but she wanted gentle hugs and kisses and nothing more, she says.""When he wanted to have sex with me, I stopped him and pushed him away saying it just felt disgusting"".Later, when she fell in love with another person, she had the same reaction. Both her boyfriends and friends had advised her to see a doctor.""My ex-boyfriends told me that if I don't go to the doctor, 'we should reconsider our relationship’.""But I feel like I'm a normal person. I just hate sex"".When studying abroad six years ago, she thought she had found her perfect partner when a man told her he did not like having sex either.""But it turned out that he did not mean it"".They have been friends since.A 2020 study on ‘The reality of building romantic relationships of asexual people in Vietnam’ by Asexual in Vietnam, an online group which has over 23,000 followers on Facebook, found asexual people want to have romantic relationships like everyone else but with mutual respect and understanding of each other's sexual orientation.Most surveyed people believe that an asexual person marrying someone similar will have a happy and long marriage.On the other hand, heterosexuals still have sexual desire and their asexual partner will feel guilty when seeing them sacrifice their need to maintain the marriage.Cat Hat Tuan, one of the administrators of Asexual in Vietnam, says asexuals may struggle to find love and marry someone similar since Vietnamese asexuals often keep a low profile, making it difficult for others to find them.Cat Hat Tuan speaks at the eighth anniversary of the Facebook group Asexual in Vietnam in March 2021. Photo courtesy of TuanThe group began a program called ‘Heart Of Color’ in March this year to bring together the asexual community in the country.While it has made people happy they are able to migle with members of their community, it has not helped them find a partner.""Some members have started dating, but there has been no marriage,"" Tuan says.Anh became a member of an asexual online community seven years ago and has met a lot of its members. She also posts online that she is looking a platonic relationship even if it is with someone 10 years younger than her.Some did reply, but she has been unable to find anyone meeting all her conditions.""Now I no longer dream of finding a partner. I'm determined to be single"".Dang Khoa, 29, a good-looking IT engineer in Hanoi, has had two relationships in the past, but both stopped at hugging and kissing.There were even times when his girlfriends took the initiative to have sex, but he refused.Like many people in the community, Khoa wishes to have a wife to grow old with and raise children had through assisted reproductive technology.He actively participates in asexual community groups and posts on dating apps to find a partner with the same mindset.He says: ""I know it is very difficult to find a girlfriend I like, who is also asexual like me. But I won't give up"".Sex is the biggest barrier to finding love for asexual people. The idea that ""love goes hand in hand with sex"" or ""sex is a need that everyone must have"" prevents asexual people from maintaining a lasting romantic relationship.Family pressures force some people to get married, and it invariably ends up tragically.Mai, 35, of Quang Ninh Province married a man with a high sex drive.Their three-year marriage broke up when Mai was 26.She says: ""He did not care about my feelings. Sometimes he insisted and forced me even though I did not want to"".She became determined to raise her children by herself as a single mother without men in her life or sex.But two years ago she was attracted to a man who had divorced. They soon became business partners. When he confessed his love,Mai also made it clear she was a person who did not want sex.""It was surprising when he said he wanted to grow old with me, love me just for who I am and not for sex"".Mai, getting married with the man, now has a happy family and is about to welcome a new member. She wanted to have a child with her husband and so agreed to have sex.She feels lucky her husband fully understands and respects her.Family pressure was the reason Bich Thuy’s parents, who live in HCMC's Binh Thanh District, married 25 years ago.Both were asexual.The 24-year-old girl says: ""My parents never locked the bedroom door. I have never seen a condom in the house or my parents look at each other lovingly"".When he was 39, her father’s mother forced him to marry.Thuy’s mother had then been 29. She hated sex, but ended up marrying Thuy's father and giving birth to Thuy and her younger sister.""My parents said they never kissed,"" Thuy says.Their marriage has been a happy one between two people who are close friends, and they pluck each other's gray hairs, cook together, clean the house, and raise their children together.Thuy and her sister grew up in a loving and happy family.Thuy is also asexual, and is not interested in sex or romantically attracted to any gender. But she wants to find a partner, but an asexual woman rather than a man.""It will be a family of two close friends, living happily and relying on each other like in families that exist in some Western countries"".","Vietnam,gender,asexual,marriage,love life,dating"
life,life-without-lust-confessions-of-asexuals-4382910.html,Life without lust: confessions of asexuals,"""I have no interest in or need for sex, so I decided not to try it,"" she says.This is not because she experienced some kind of sexual trauma in the past: Linh is asexual, a group that makes up about 1 percent of the world's population.Professor Anthony Bogaert a psychologist and human sexuality expert at Brock University in Canada, says asexual people are not attracted to other people.They can be divided into two categories, he adds: those who have no sexual desire at all and those who have some degree of sexual desire but do not direct this desire directly at others and instead masturbate.Khanh Linh in a photo shoot taken 5 years ago in HCMC. Photo courtesy of LinhLinh realized at a very early age she had no interest in sex, but did not know the concept of asexual until she went abroad to study a few years ago.""I'm relieved I can finally label myself,"" she says.Cat Hat Tuan of the northern Vinh Phuc Province also took a long time to truly understand himself. While in school, he was confused about his orientation after discovering he had feelings for a male friend and thought ""I must be gay"".Unlike his friends, he felt lost when someone spoke about sex.""It was not until 2015 that I got to know about the asexual community and learn that my appropriate label was homoromantic asexual, meaning I have no sexual desire but was still emotionally attracted to men"".Hoang Tung, 23, an English teacher in Saigon, says he is both asexual and aromantic.From a very young age Tung has identified himself as asexual. Most of his friends started to like the opposite sex while in seventh or eighth grade and talked about the people they secretly loved, while he realized that he was not interested in these things.""When my friends talk about masturbation, sex or talk about girls, I just feel disgusted"".Most asexuals face social stigma. In online community groups, where members often share their coming out experiences, many say they are ridiculed.Some people look down on them for not knowing how to love and avoiding marriage and even claim they label themselves asexual merely to gain support from the LGBT community.Some are accused of using asexuality as an ""excuse"" to remain single, while others are sexually harassed in public.""I want to freely share what I feel with everyone, but some people say, 'You won't know if you haven't tried it,'"" Linh says.Tuan is teased by friends as being ""physically weak"" and ""impotent"".Because he found it too difficult to explain, he told his parents he was ""gay"".When Tung confided to his close friends while in 10th grade, they told him: ""There are no asexual people in the world. Sex is a part of life and human nature"".The strong reactions scared Tung away from broaching the topic again, but the damage was done already: his friends told the others in class, who began to make fun of him.Now, whenever he is with a group of male friends, he has to pretend he also likes discussing about girls and sex.When someone in his family asks him about a girlfriend, he avoids answering them.""But the idea of starting a relationship has never crossed my mind"".He says when he was in college he met up with an old friend one time for coffee and they reminisced about sad and happy stories from high school. When it was his turn, Tung did not know what to say. That night, after returning to the dormitory, he ran into the hallway and ""couldn't stop crying"" since he had kept his feelings pent up for too long.A 2012 study by another Brock University psychology professor, Gordon Hodson, found asexual people were viewed more negatively than homosexuals.A 2015 study on asexual people published by Dominique Canning, a PhD candidate at the University of Michigan in the U.S. said asexuality is misunderstood and despised by the LGBT community.They might have little or no sex drive, but many asexual people nevertheless want to find love and even marry.Linh used to be a model in Saigon and an intern in a law firm, and men were attracted by her looks and personality.One time she was attracted by the affection and care a man showed toward her, and accepted to go out with him on a date.But right at the beginning she made it clear she was asexual and was not interested in having sex.""My ex-boyfriend agreed to my condition, but did not believe it. He thought I was just saying so and will change my mind later on.""After three relationships, she realized that even if a man loved her and agreed with her wishes, sex and children would be inevitable in a marriage. So she decided to be single. Outside of work, she finds joy in reading books, drawing, dancing, and other activities.The discovery that he was asexual changed Tuan's life. While in his third year at university, he moved from polytechnic to the University of Social Sciences and Humanities in Hanoi to major in social work.He currently works at a medical center in the city andactively participates in an online group named Asexual in Vietnam, which has over 23,000 followers on Facebook.Meanwhile, Tung is not too sure about what to tell his family even as the frequency of questions about his romantic life increases by the day.""I have never been self-conscious about my sexual orientation because I was born with it, just like people are born with hands and feet.""","Vietnam,Vietnamese,asexual,sexual orientation,LGBT"

Photo by VnExpress/Ha AnSince Saigon lifted the five-month ban on serving customers indoors in late October, many restaurants and coffee shops have been overrun by guests who ignore social distancing requirements.Crowds were seen at many eateries and public places like Nguyen Hue Street or District 3’s Turtle Lake in the last few days, with many people not wearing masks or keeping a distance from others.""The daily number of new Covid cases is significantly less than several months ago, and so we ought to enjoy this,"" Nguyen Trong Hung, who was hanging out with his friends at Turtle Lake, a favorite spot for young people, said.""Normally we wear masks but we cannot wear them while having snacks and bubble tea,"" his friend said while drinking tea.Many eateries have ignored the rules that they can have only 50 percent of their normal covers, close by 9 p.m. and not serve alcoholic beverages (except in District 7 and Thu Duc City).At 9 p.m. many restaurants on Pham Van Dong Street, which runs between Binh Thanh and Go Vap districts, are still noisy with sounds of people drinking and chatting.A restaurant in Go Vap District has a sign saying ""no alcoholic beverages served"", but dozens of people sit and drink inside, cans of beer all over the ground. The manager of the eatery said they are forced to sell beer to customers because ""no one comes to a beer restaurant just to eat.""Pham Thanh Quang, 39, who was sitting with a friend, said he had been at home for too long and now wants to venture out to ""have a different vibe"".""I was at home during more than four months of lockdown, and so I am hanging out with friends tonight.

The pandemic is gradually coming under control, but around 1,000 people still contract the disease every day.According to Dr Vu Dinh An, deputy director of the Covid-19 treatment center at Hospital 175, many people are careless when going out and congregate at amusement places without wearing masks or maintaining social distance.

life,trend,Hanoians spend big on teaching young dogs tricks,"Two weeks after he had sent his puppy to a training center, Ngo Quang Thang of Long Bien District met his Golden Retriever again and noticed obvious changes.""My dog is healthier, more agile and more obedient,"" he said, adding that he had spent VND9 million ($395.75) on the training course.Ngo Quang Thanh visits his Golden Retriever at the dog training center. Photo by VnExpress/Nguyen NgoanHe bought the dog in July this year when it was just two months old. Untrained, it often peed inside the house.Thang believes that it is important for dogs to form desirable habits and develop some skills at a young age. So when his puppy was five months old, he sent it to the PDS Professional Dog Training Center in Gia Lam District. Every weekend, he or his relatives visit the center and play with the dog.Before signing the contract, he carefully reviewed the center's commitment and discussed at length what he wanted out of the training program. He wanted his pet to be more disciplined and in better physical health, as also receive the right medical care he needed.Tran Le Thanh Tien, 24, a trainer and veterinarian at the PDS Professional Dog Training Center, said over the past four or five years, the demand for having dogs trained and taken care of at the center has increased.The facility, established in 1996, trains about 100 dogs of many different breeds.A short training course is a month long, while the longer one can last up to three months, depending on the needs of the owner.Pets first get acquainted with the trainer, food and the living environment before they are trained to do tricks like standing, lying, sitting, shaking hands and ""faking death"".Le Thanh Tien trains a German Shepherd. Photo by VnExpress/Nguyen NgoanAfter finishing the course, the board of directors of the center will grade the pet's performance. If it passes, the dog can ""graduate"" from the school; if not, it will have to redo the course.Each customer coming to the center has different needs. Some want their dogs to be better behaved, some want them not to bark when indoors and some want to get rid of their pet's habit of biting and scratching chairs and tables. Then there are owners who want their dogs trained to become fiercer and not timid.Each trainer will meet directly with the owner to find out the latter’s wishes and aspirations. If they want the dog to be aggressive, the center will focus on early neurological stimulation that helps enhance the natural abilities of dogs. In contrast, a pet that needs to be more gentle and friendly will be trained to become more ""socialized"" with its trainer and other dogs.""The price for a course is between VND8-9 million. But for dogs like Pitbulls or Tibetan Mastiffs, which are more difficult to train and need more experienced trainers, we charge VND12 million for each course,"" Tien said. ""We can also teach dogs special commands, like attack to protect the owner, besides the basic tricks.""Tien said the most difficult thing in training was the first day of getting to know the pet. Many of them do not like strangers, so they attack the coach and do not allow them to get close. It might take trainers one to a few days to befriend some fierce dogs.Training begins after the dog and the trainer have gotten to know each other. Every day, pets get to play around in the grass or concrete yard first the actual training begins, each session lasting 15-30 minutes. Trainers take care not to over-exercise pets because it can easily leads to the dog's disinterest and unwillingness to cooperate.They are released to play in the field after each session and return to the cage to rest or continue the exercise a second time.The diet for all dogs is the same and they all eat together. Their diet includes bran, chicken head or neck, liver and beef. Trainers also change the menu regularly so their wards don’t get bored.""Currently, the center has 11 coaches, with each training 5-10 dogs,"" Tien said.Two dogs go through their training sessions. Photo by VnExpress/Nguyen NgoanTien said coaches are trained for three months, from basic skills of getting acquainted and to full-fledged coaching. After graduation, they are awarded certificates and can receive dogs for training.The important prerequisite for a trainer is to love the job and love the pet, he said.""Each dog has its own personality that one has to relate to. So one needs to have a passion for this job before they can start teaching the dogs effectively.""Hoang Thai Bao, a 24-year-old animal lover, has applied to be a trainer at the center.Given a choice between learning to train regular or fierce dogs, Bao has chosen the former because they are cute and more approachable.At the moment, he is taking care of three puppies- a Husky, an Alaskan and a Golden Retriever.""Sometimes I get bitten and injured. Since some of them are pampered at home, they get angry easily when they first arrive at the center,"" he said, adding that it can take a week or even a month for dogs to become less aggressive and start to get along with the trainer.The bottom line is that ""dog training is difficult, but for dog lovers, it is more a hobby than a job.""","Vietnam,dog training center,dog,pet,canine,trainer,Hanoi"

There were 48,200 calls in July, 50,800 in August, and 46,800 in September, nearly double the number of calls in the previous months.The calls revolved around topics like healthcare, psychological support, mental health of children and advice related to Covid-19.""Especially in the parents-children relationship, we have recorded an increase in complaints about parents yelling, beating and over-controlling their children,"" said Le Thi Thao, deputy head of the national hotline service.Reports from pandemic-hit countries from the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF) also show that economic pressures arising out of the current situation of travel restrictions and social distancing has led to increased violence, especially against women and girls. In many countries, domestic violence has increased from 30 percent to 300 percent.More than a month ago, at 2 a.m., the National Hotline 111 on Child Protection received a call from a resident in Hanoi’s Dong Anh District, informing that a neighboring family was abusing a child, a third-grader who had been crying for a long time.Pham Viet Hong, the operator on duty, immediately contacted the regional police. After about 40 minutes, the police announced that ""the house was quiet, people have turned off the light to sleep.""Pham Viet Hong talks with a person on the phone on Oct. 21, 2021, in Hanoi. Photo by VnExpress/Phan DuongThe next day, Hong contacted the local authorities, who later talked with the family. The parents explained that due to the Covid-19 economic crunch, they had to stay at home and could not make money, so the husband and wife were in conflict. When they found that their daughter had not finished her homework, they scolded her.""They said they only threatened her and did not hit her. She became afraid and cried,"" Hong said.The parents have promised that they would not threaten their daughter again. And at the same time, local authorities would keep their watchful eyes on them.Frustration during the pandemic also drove a mother in the capital city’s Thanh Xuan District to kick her two children, nine and six years old, out of their house.""The two children walked to the Covid-19 checkpoint at the mouth of the alley, but they had to return because the guards did not let them pass. The mother continued to chase them away. This time, they borrowed a phone from a guard to call their father,"" Hong recalled.The parents had divorced a few years ago and were now married to different people. After receiving the call from his daughters, the father, living in Da Nang, called the hotline for help.When the local authorities came, the mother said that the children’s stepfather and she still took good care of them. What happened was just ""words spoken in anger.""However, the girls’ father did not accept the explanation. Finally, the mother admitted that she had been angry and had chased her daughters and kicked them out.She said the pressure of taking care of a newborn had made her ignore the two older children and she was more frustrated because she did not receive money from her ex-husband.Families are normally a safe haven for children, but with schools closed for a long time, some homes have sites of . Many children are subjected to verbal and physical violence.Recently, the national hotline received a call for help from a woman in the central province of Thanh Hoa. She was the aunt of an 11-year-old girl whose mother had run away from her abusive husband.The husband, having lost his job and taking to drink, vented his anger on the daughter.""The girl was studying in my house when her father came in suddenly and slapped her in the face and head,"" said the aunt, who had already asked local authorities to intervene in vain.The hotline’s operator was now working with local authorities to intervene and protect the child.The complications of the fourth Covid-19 outbreak in the country have pushed the unemployment rate to its highest level in nearly two years, affecting millions of Vietnamese families.Of more than 69,000 workers surveyed by  and the Private Economic Development Research Board (IV Board) in August, up to 50 percent did not have enough money to live even for one month.""The economic catastrophe caused by the pandemic has stressed out many parents, and children are the ultimate bearers of pressure (from their parents),"" Thao said.Staying at home for too long can pose negative effects on children's health. Illustration photo by Phan DuongPsychologist Hong Huong, working with the Vietnam Association for Protection of Children's Rights, said that the real cause of child abuse is that adults have never seriously learned to manage their mental issues. The pandemic has become a hotbed for them to rant against their children, who are more vulnerable.""There is nothing easier than ‘littering’ their ‘mental’ waste on their children, especially young ones. They do not know how to resist, they are completely defeated,"" the psychologist said. She found that in most cases, after their rants, parents do feel regret and want to make up to their children, but this gets repeated again.During the pandemic, Hanoi psychologist Kim Thanh has also received many calls from parents and children.""One day I received three calls from three crying mothers, saying they wanted to die and were too tired and helpless because their children were disobedient,"" the psychologist said.Amidst tensions generated by the pandemic, small things like a child disobeying can worsen adults’ negative feelings and emotions; then they just want to beat their children and even destroy themselves.""In case they get angry, parents need to immediately drink a glass of water to calm down, take a deep breath to regulate the air in their body and switch to doing other things they like in order to redirect their thoughts. They should teach or deal with their children only when they are calm,"" Thanh said.Psychologist Huong said that in order to minimize parents’ ranting, the community should equip adults with skills to properly care for and protect their children.She said having a child meant that parents need to provide them with physical and mental nourishment. Childhood emotional trauma can cause distortions in thinking and lifestyle when people are grown up, and there are injuries that cannot be healed, she warned.She said parents should practice emotional management with the 25/60 principle.

Now my dream has come true,"" he said, as he set out for the Cat Linh Station to try the country’s first metro.Thanh is one of hundreds of excited residents waiting to try out the route and find an escape from the daily drudgery of rush hour traffic jams that have plagued major cities in Vietnam because of a lack of efficient public transportation and the resultant large number of personal vehicles – motorbikes and cars – on the road.Hanoi Deputy Chairman Duong Duc Tuan said the metro line would help increase the number of public transport users, and together with the nine other routes planned, form a key transport network that will reduce traffic congestion.Cat Linh metro station in Hanoi, Nov. 6, 2021.

life,trend,'Squid Game' global craze hits Vietnam too,"Videos with the hashtag #trochoiconmuc (‘Tro Choi Con Muc’ is the Vietnamese name of ‘Squid Game’) have garnered more than 457 million views on the short video platform TikTok.The deadly South Korean sweet treat from the series, known as Dalgona candy, or honeycomb toffee, has taken social media by storm. In the last few weeks its recipe has generated a lot of buzz among Vietnamese netizens, who record videos of themselves making the candy in various shapes.In the series, the game is all about scraping away the outside of the candy to get the stamped shape out without breaking it.Young people have been sharing recipes, trying the challenge out, and re-enacting the episode [involving the candy], attracting huge attention on social networks.The South Korean series 'Squid Game' has sparked many trends among young Vietnamese in the last few weeks, from creating Dalgona candies to dressing up as characters in the series.People try out the Dalgona candy challenge at a coffee shops in Hanoi's Ba Dinh District. Photo by VnExpress/Nguyen NgoanSince premiering on Sept. 17, the nine-episode show on global streaming service Netflix has become number one in over 90 countries and territories.Directed and written by Hwang Dong-hyuk, its plot is about contestants who are in so much debt that they ended up competing in classic children's games for $38 million cash prizes.The twist is that debt-ridden participants are not simply competing for money: they are also playing for their lives. Losing means death.Le Petit Moment Cafe, a coffee shop in Hanoi's Ba Dinh District, quickly grasped the trend and began offering the do-or-die candy challenge for customers who want to put their scraping skills to the test while enjoying a sugar high.Van, the shop's owner, said she started offering this candy-splitting game on Oct. 15, one day after Hanoi permitted dine-in customers.Van explained why she came up with the idea of offering the candies at her café: ""‘Squid Game’ was so popular that it created many social media trends, including the Dalgona candy challenge. Many people try making the candy at home but fail"".She said her shop attracts hundreds of visitors every day as a result.""My shop sells 100 to 150 candies during weekdays. But on weekends the number doubles, even triples"". She said she has to refuse customers who order a large number of the candies.""""I have sold over 3,000 Dalgona candies so far"".Young customers come to the shop to play, some people buy up to 10 pieces after failing many times.""I traveled more than 15 km from Gia Lam District to this shop because of this ‘Squid Game’ candy,"" Nguyen Van Dung, 20, said.She bought a star-shaped and heart-shaped candy each for VND58,000 ($2.56).In HCMC too, some restaurants have introduced the trendy candy in their menus.Vietnamese dress up as their favorite characters from 'Squid Games'.

life,culture,Vietnamese antiques fetch high prices at global auctions,"A Vietnamese mandarin cap believed to be from the Nguyen Dynasty, the last of Vietnam's royal rulers, late 19th century-early 20th century, sold for €600,000 ($693,243) at a Balclis auction in Spain on Oct. 28. It comes with a box in lacquered and gilded wood, and has ""some flaws and defects,"" the auction house stated. The item was introduced on Oct. 20 with an initial price of €500. Ten vying bidders eventually pushed the price tag up to €600,000. The final bidder is an anonymous online collector.
Tran Dinh Son, a researcher, said the cap belonged to a high-ranking mandarin, was well preserved and similar to artifacts on display in Hue, Ho Chi Minh City and Hanoi, meaning it was not all that rare. Before 1945, several families either buried the caps with the deceased mandarins or kept them for worship.
""I'm surprised to hear that the cap got a record-breaking price. In Vietnam, a similar item could be sold for around $10,000,"" he said.
Vu Kim Loc, an artisan who specializes in restoring Nguyen Dynasty caps, said he was not surprised to see the cap fetching a high price at a foreign auction. He said there were only around five to seven similar mandarin caps in Vietnam, and that caps belonging to high-ranking mandarins were even rarer. Photo courtesy of the Balclis auction houseAt another auction the same day, a ceremonial costume from the Nguyen dynasty was eventually sold for €35,000 after bidding started at €800. Son said Vietnamese artifacts have gained traction on the international auction scene over the past five years, thanks to affluent Vietnamese abroad helping to spread the word.

He reportedly went shopping for the Rolex in the spring of 1954 while attending the Geneva Convention, which split Vietnam in two.
The unique Rolex includes a small 36 millimeter yellow gold triple calendar moon phase and is the only known example with the reference 6062 with a black dial and diamond indexes, according to leading watch website .

It was purchased by Monuments Conservation Center in central Thue Thien Hue Province and is on display at Hue Royal Palace. The rickshaw was bought by her son - King Thanh Thai (1879-1954) - for his mother to travel around the palace. After the king was dethroned, it was sold to a Frenchman in 1907. After more than 100 years, it was auctioned in France.
Phan Thanh Hai, director of Hue Monuments Conservation Center at the time, said the rickshaw was among the most beautiful in Vietnam, exquisitely inlaid with pearls by a group of famous artisans in the North.

As the local health station received multiple emergency calls, the phone ringing sound haunted many healthcare workers.""Medics were exhausted while the number of calls kept flushing in,"" Dr Le Ba Kong, head of Binh Chieu Ward's health station, recalled.Binh Chieu Ward has more than 80,000 people; about two-thirds are migrant workers living in rented rooms, including stacked houses with shared restrooms, a hotbed for the coronavirus.Medics in Binh Chieu Ward take a Covid patient to the hospital. Photo courtesy of Binh Chieu health stationThe ward has Binh Chieu Industrial Park, Linh Trung Export Processing Zone, adjacent to Thu Duc wholesale market. At that time, many workers and traders had got one dose of Covid vaccine, so they dropped their guards. At the wholesale market, porters and sales did not wear masks because of the heat and difficulties in breathing.Initially, the pandemic broke out in a company with 140 infections. Around 700 people were coming into close contact with them.""The station was overwhelmed by a large amount of patients' information, we did not have time to confirm many of them,"" Kong recalled.The local health station had eight people handling everything from processing patients' documents to conducting contact tracing.Doctors and nurses all had to work at night, with no time to rest. There were not enough medical equipment and ambulances, so they had to mobilize equipment from benefactors.After borrowing a car from an acquaintance, Kong then organized a night medical examination.""I sat in the car to make a phone call to inquire about the situation of the patients then I drove to distribute medicine,"" Kong said, adding he started visiting Covid patients' house at around 7 p.m. and did not come home until 2-3 a.m. on the following day.""There were many nights, we took patients to three different hospitals but none had oxygen cylinders left for them.""Local medics many times helplessly witnessed Covid patients die right in front of their eyes.Among the patients who succumbed to Covid, there was a young man whose family called for help at 4:15 a.m. When doctors arrived, it was too late to save him. The man died 15 minutes later.From mid-July, the situation began to improve as healthcare workers from the private sector and other provinces joined their hands in the midst of the pandemic.Medical equipment, packages, and oxygen cylinders were fully provided, helping the local health authorities give full support to Covid patients.Binh Chieu health station was supported by three military medics, four healthcare workers from northern Hai Duong Province, two doctors from a private hospital, and four other doctors checking up on Covid patients by phone.Thanks to the support, the station could do the job better.Doctor Nguyen Huy Manh from a private clinic join medics on Binh Chieu health station to treat local Covid patients. Photo courtesy of Binh Chieu health stationAll positive cases were thoroughly verified, patients' living spaces were also disinfected and isolated. A mobile medical team and private medical center cooperated to treat patients at home, and quickly responded in case of emergency.When the health sector in HCMC had a better process and solution to deal with the outbreak, equipment and medicine were fully supplied, so Binh Chieu Ward's health station decided to keep patients in its centralized quarantine area.Many have recovered from the disease and volunteered to give medics a helping hand.""We had a lot of works, the number of cases is still high, but everyone feels less pressure,"" said Kong.Many elderly patients rejected to go to the hospital, wanting to stay at home, doctors had to discuss carefully before coming up with solutions.The treatment team at that time included traditional medicine doctors, specialists in surgery, internal medicine, otolaryngology, and psychiatry, so they were confident when deciding which patients could stay at home, monitoring their health around the clock carefully.Overcoming the initial difficulties, the clinic gradually got on its feet. During the recent outbreak, the ward recorded more than 7,500 patients. More than 100 of them were isolated at home.Looking back on the recent arduous battle, Kong wished to have specialized training and specific policies for local clinics.He hoped that the public health sector would ""have a mechanism to cooperate with the private health sector, because currently the cooperation is all based on personal relations, there is no mechanism to follow.""Last weekend, deputy director of HCMC Health Department, Nguyen Van Vinh Chau, said the municipal healthcare system has weaknesses in the recent outbreak, and it is necessary to improve its quality and efficiency; adjust and publish appropriate policies to attract human resources, especially for clinics in local wards, communes, and town.At an online meeting with 140 voters working in the healthcare sector on Oct. 9, deputy director of the department proposed the city should assign a quota on the number of people working for a health station based on the local population. The goal is to ensure sufficient human resources for primary care, medical examination, and treatment, preventing future epidemics.HCMC has recorded more than 438,000 Covid cases in the current outbreak, starting late April. The city lifted its stringent lockdown on Oct. 1, allowing more socio-economic activities to resume.","HCMC,Saigon,Covid,patients,outbreak,pandemic"

She wants to visit her parents for the weekend but is confused by the regulations.She contacted health authorities in her hometown, but they said the rules depend on the pandemic situation.""Too complicated,"" Ngoc says.People scan QR codes to make health declaration before entering northern Quang Ninh Province, Oct. 16, 2021. Photo by VnExpress/Minh CuongA resolution on adapting to Covid-19 issued earlier this month categorized areas into four risk levels, with 1 being lowest.The criteria are determined by the Ministry of Health based on factors like community transmission, vaccination and Covid-19 treatment.In Hai Phong, people who return before midnight on a day have to follow rules based on the risk level of that day.The risk is freshly assessed after midnight.But even when provinces and cities have allowed interprovincial transportation to resume, people are hesitant about visiting their hometown.A quick survey of such people by  found their worries are related to unclear regulations on quarantine, transport difficulties, expensive bus tickets, fear of not being able to return to their place of work, fear of infection, and stigma related to returning to a pandemic-hit area.Tien Hung, 27, who lives in Hanoi’s Nam Tu Liem District, wanted to return to the central Thanh Hoa Province and tried to find a car.There are few buses, and the main mode of transport is private car. The price of a seat pre-Covid was VND200,000 ($8.82), but is now up to VND500,000, depending on the pick-up and drop off points.He could not afford to spend a million dong just to return home for a weekend.The confusing quarantine rules also rattled Hung.Some Thanh Hoa people living in Hanoi said those coming from moderate-risk areas in Hanoi do not have to quarantine at home, take a quick test or present documents to prove their current place of residence. But others said they must self-monitor their health or isolate themselves for seven days even if they have had two Covid shots.Hung says: ""There is too much information and I do not know whom to believe. People like me do not dare to take the risks to visit home unless there are urgent matters.""Le Van Phuong, chairman of the People's Committee of Hoang Quy Commune in Thanh Hoa's Hoang Hoa District, his native village, says: ""Before returning, people should ask for a certificate from the ward where they live to prove that it is a safe area, and [also] bring their vaccination certificates"".After they make health declarations, the commune would consider the pandemic situation at their place of departure to take measures, he said.Le Thuy, 26, of Hau Loc District in Thanh Hoa Province, has also been confused by the quarantine regulations. She found out that fully vaccinated people living in moderate-risk areas need to self-isolate if their second shot were taken less than 14 days prior.Their house will have to put on a sign saying ""family has a member returning from pandemic area.""But in Hanoi and many other places, people like Thuy only have to self-monitor their health at home for 14 days.""I need a specific guide that applies to all provinces so that I can return to my hometown with peace of mind,"" she says.A police man controls the flow of people entering central Nghe An Province.

Many vaccinated people are still infected, and so self-isolation could still pose a risk to communities.""If the regulations on pandemic prevention are not strictly complied with and the situation gets out of control, it will be very dangerous,"" Nam warns.Many people are also hesitating to return simply because they worry they might carry the virus home.Nguyen Tam, 34, of Nghe An Province lives and works in Dong Nai Province, which used to be a high-risk area.

A 2017 report titled Psychological Impact of Social Networks on User Psychology published by the Hanoi University of Social Sciences and Humanities said 20 percent of Vietnamese spent more than three hours a day on social networks and 54 percent spent more than an hour, 39 percent were very upset if social media was shut down, 37 percent said it was an important part of their life and 35 percent were upset and lost if they could not access it for one or two days.When conducting an experiment that involved spending 72 hours without social media, more than 43 percent of participants broke their commitment within the first six hours.Common emotional states participants reported were feeling a loss of connection with friends, fear they would miss out on what was trending or going on online and a feeling of anxiety.Social media dependence is just the beginning of many mental problems, U.S.-based therapist and psychiatrist, Nguyen Huong Linh, says.""People who cannot get away from social networks often have many mental problems.""They look to the virtual world to avoid these difficulties and on the other hand to show people online that they are fine"".Dependence on social networks shows that young people do not have many tools to deal with their problems and resort to the cheapest and most accessible way to escape real-life problems, she says.It is also a manifestation of those feeling disconnected from their parents or isolated at school.When they want to forget their problems, people immediately ""reach for their phones"", she says.Echoing Linh's opinion, Chau says people addicted to social media often ""feel vulnerable"".""For them, social networks become a place to hide from their problems"".Nguyen Hoai Nam, 22, is one such person. He has not lived with his parents since childhood, has few friends, and was bullied at school, and social media is a consolation. On his personal page, the student living in France posts carefully edited travel photos to attract as many ‘likes’ as possible.The frequency of uploading depends on how he feels at a particular time. ""The sadder I feel, the more I post"".For Nga, the fact that others liked her child’s photos and congratulated her gave her a feeling of recognition.Trang feels her presence ""matters"" when she is the one who knows the latest hot topics online among her group of friends.Experts say the number of people who seek help to treat addiction to social networks is quite small, but this does not mean it is not a problem.Unlike addiction to alcohol or shopping, social media dependence is not condemned and its consequences are difficult to see immediately, but experts say it does have a big impact on the physiology and psychology of individuals and on society.Chau says if ""addicted"", people become lazy and sluggish, struggle to focus on other things and even ignore their other basic needs.For instance, Trang is ready to reduce her sleep and spend more time on ""keeping up with the latest news and trends"".It also causes stress and anxiety.""If I don't get a certain number of 'likes', I am very sad because I think I am not doing well enough,"" Nam says.He considers it a measure of his success and other people’s regard for him.Social networks have affected the mental health of Nguyen Ngoc Nha, 30, of Bac Tu Liem District, who envies other people online and loses self-esteem.""Watching my friends shop for luxury goods, I feel jealous,"" the office worker admits.Nha was also sad because a friend delivered a child at the same time as her, but recovered faster, had enough money to employ a help and got more free time to hang out with friends.Social media dependence also worsens human connections, because the more they are dependent on the Internet, the more they are addicted and the more they withdraw from the real world and lose communication skills.The report Psychological Impact of Social Networks on User Psychology found that the number of friends online is directly proportionate to the level of loneliness, anxiety and depression and inversely proportionate to the level of satisfaction with life.Linh says: ""The need for sympathy, validation and recognition is legitimate and necessary. But we also need to learn how to seek them through traditional methods the way we did before social networks were created"".Experts further note that dependence is not only found in young people but also middle-aged and senior people.Despite knowing the consequences, it is not easy to change one's habits related to the use of social media.Nam thinks he ""sooner or later has to find a way to express himself differently"" and has set a goal of only spending two hours a day online instead of the earlier five hours.Nha chooses to ‘unfollow’ all accounts that make her lose self-esteem. In her free time, she plays with her children and learns about business operations to help accomplish her plan to open a cafe.Trang is trying not to browse at night because her health has been affected.Nga admits reducing her dependence on social networks will be a struggle.""Without it, I might die"".","Vietnam,social media addiction,social media dependence"

Photo by VnExpress/Giang HuyIn both Hanoi and HCMC, employees at eateries must be fully vaccinated, and customers have to make a health declaration via QR code before entering.As the country learns to live with the virus, the government is urging people to be personally responsible to ensure safety.Besides speeding up vaccination, it is gradually lifting mandates and restrictions to reopen the economy.Restaurants and other food and beverage establishments in Hanoi and HCMC are allowed to have dine-in customers at half their maximum capacity.While the capital has not permitted businesses to sell alcohol, HCMC has given the green light to regular restaurants in District 7 and Thu Duc City to serve alcohol on a trial basis until Nov. 15, but requires all to close by 9 p.m.The country is still gingerly moving toward normalcy but the pandemic remains a threat.In recent days new clusters have been found in many parts of the country, mostly linked to people returning from HCMC and its neighboring localities after they eased restrictions in early Oct., allowing migrant workers to travel to their hometowns.Northern localities like Hanoi and Bac Giang and Vinh Phuc provinces have also reported infections among returnees. As of Monday, the country has recorded more than 916,000 Covid cases in the current outbreak.Minister of Health Nguyen Thanh Long said Sunday: ""We are worried about new outbreaks in the coming time. Localities need to remain vigilant.""In HCMC, Tung plans to eat hotpot with his friends this weekend, something they have not done since the outbreak resurfaced in late April.He has bought some Covid test kits and will use them if he has symptoms.""I enjoy normal life but I will not forget that the coronavirus is still here and will be here for long.""","Vietnam,reopening,new normal,HCMC,Hanoi,post-lockdown"

Photo courtesy of NhuNhu first began doing this in 2014, when she joined a group of friends that rescued and treated badly injured dogs. But after a while the others became too busy and gave up, but Nhu decided to continue with the mission.When asked what motivates her to do it, she says: ""There are many organizations specializing in helping less fortunate people. But animals also need a warm embrace and attention, and I want to show them what love is"".Khanh, not an animal lover to begin with, was persuaded by Nhu, then his girlfriend, and became a willing convert.When she was first starting out, Nhu hid what she was doing from her parents, worried they would stop her. But once when she took them to the rescue center to see the animals, they too began to back her.At the moment she is taking care of over 350 cats and dogs, spending nearly VND100 million ($4,388) a month to buy them food and other requirements.She runs a pet store at home and helps her family run an eatery, while Khanh has a photo studio.Their Facebook page, Cuu Ho Cho Meo Saigon Time (Rescuing Cats and Dogs Saigon Time), has garnered more than 130,000 likes, and compliments and encouragement constantly pour in from the online community.""You are doing a great job, I will support your pet shop so you will have money to take care of these lovely animals,"" is a typical comment they received.Nhu says animal lovers often message her on Facebook to ask if she can take in a stray or abandoned animal. But due to the large number of such requests, she only takes in animals that are sick or badly injured.""Many pets tend to be scared and bite when we first bring them home since they were neglected or abused and have psychological problems.""However when we care for them, we slowly earn their trust and help them transition and adjust to the new environment"".What she and her husband strive to do is find a new home for them, which also allows them to take in more cats and dogs.To help them find the right home, she sends prospective owners a list of questions, meets them in person and has the animal live with them for two weeks to see if they fit.She also lets them know that if one day they no longer want or are able to take care of the animal, they should return it to her instead of giving it to others.Those who've adopted pets from Nhu said she is ""super selective"" when choosing new ""parents"" for her animal charges.""I had to answer a lot of questions and keep updating her about my adopted cat,"" Le Hoang San, a District 6 resident, said.Nguyen Thanh Quynh Nhi from Go Vap District recalled Nhu usually checked on her dog after adoption.""Nhu is careful when choosing owners for her 'kids', always warning us she would selective.""Nhu and Khanh got married in April 2021. Photo courtesy of NhuThe pandemic and recent lockdown in Saigon have taken a toll on their rescue center.Since her pet store and eatery were closed for months, Nhu did not have enough money to buy food for her animals and had to borrow VND50 million from friends.""Luckily, things are slowly getting back on track now, I can make money to take care of them and repay the debt"". She says she is an optimist and the pandemic could not stop her from caring for her animals.Indeed, the two adopted more than 100 cats and dogs during the recent lockdown, mostly from Covid-19 patients and those who were in quarantine and could not take care of their pets.Many people, including local authorities, knowing about Nhu’s rescue center, brought their pets to her.""I contacted those people when they recovered, but some said they cannot take care of their pets any more. So I will keep them with us until I can find them new homes.""Due to travel restrictions during the recent lockdown she could not visit the rescue center, and Khanh stayed there to take care of the animals.""I had never been away from my husband and these cats and dogs for so long, so I was thrilled to see them again on Oct. 1,"" Nhu says.The idea of giving up has crossed her mind a few times at seeing her animals die.""But Khanh and I encourage each other to keep going and not abandon our animals.""The couple once canceled their wedding and sold their wedding rings to raise some money required for the animals. They say people criticize and make fun of this often.""Of course some people will think Khanh and I are out of our minds, but we had support from our families and many animal lovers, that was the most important thing"".She says she has seen a lot of people stop rescuing animals once they have children but ""Khanh and I do not plan to have children at the moment; we want to entirely focus on our animals and help them find permanent homes.""","pets,animals,cats,dogs,HCMC,Saigon,Saigonese,Tin,Tường thuật"
life,online-child-abuse-spikes-amid-pandemic-4377503.html,Online child abuse spikes amid pandemic,"A month before graduating, Khanh Ngoc, a high school student in Hanoi, received a message from a strange Facebook account. Opening it, she encountered rude and vulgar language, prompting her to immediately press delete. Even though she did not respond, the account continued to harass her a few more times.About a week later, while chatting with friends in an online group, Ngoc discovered she was not the only victim since dozens of her friends at school had received similar harassing messages.The culprit pretended to be a member of the school's photography group taking photos for the yearbook. The person messaged students to ask them for their photos, using the excuse of ""losing the original image files.""After obtaining the photos, the offender would set up fake accounts using these images to post harassing messaged online. Some of the photos even circulated on Twitter and were posted on dark webs along with victims’ phone numbers.""We reported to the police, but the person used a lot of fake accounts, so it was difficult to track down who it was,"" Ngoc said.A sixth-grader in Hanoi studies online using a laptop. Illustration photo by Phan DuongGlobal Threat Assessment published in mid-October by WeProtect, comprising over 200 governments, private sector companies and civil society organizations combatting online child abuse and exploitation, stated: ""Covid-19 created a 'perfect storm' fueling a rise in the sexual exploitation and abuse of children across the globe"" during the past two years.Accordingly, online sexual abuse and exploitation of children have reached its highest level in many countries. For example, in the U.S., the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children processes 60,000 reports of the sexual abuse of children online each day.In Vietnam, experts said there have never been as many online child abuse cases as now.Nguyen Thi Thu Huong, deputy director of Vietnam Women's Academy, said during the social distancing period, children are at a higher risk of being abused and exploited online when exposed to social networks .According to a report by the National Hotline on Child Protection 111, from May to August 2021, about 600 cases of abuse and violence were received each month on average, an increase of nearly 1.5 times compared to the first three months of this year.In 2020, the number of calls for intensive consultation on abusive and violent content accounted for more than 47 percent, an increase of 7.2 percent compared to 2019.Operator Nguyen Viet Dung, recalled he received a call from an 8th-grade girl from northern Ha Nam Province in September. Because she was sad about family problems and studying pressure, she often shared negative emotions on her personal page. He said a person actively connected with her, got acquainted, gave her gifts and slowly gained her trust.Then the suspect lured her to send photos or videos of sensitive body parts, saying these videos were her ""proofs of love"" and promising to ""keep them private.""Gradually, this person forced her to send videos every day. When she didn't want to continue, the person threatened to publish her old videos.Experts have advised the girl that the danger behind this behavior is defamation, blackmail, even abuse in real life.""Once the images are spread, it will be very difficult to control. When the children call our hotline, we will also assist them in taking down the images and videos as much as possible,"" Dung added.Nguyen Viet Dung operates National Hotline 111 on Child Protection during his shift, Oct. 21, 2021. Photo by VnExpress/Phan DuongDue to the pandemic and social distancing regulations, Vietnamese students aged six and older have had to study online and use social networks to communicate with their teachers, and friends.Nguyen Phuong Linh, director of Management and Sustainable Development Institute (MSD), said they can face risks of being exploited and are vulnerable to abuse, especially sexual abuse in the online environment.""With the anonymity of the Internet, a child abuser can be anyone,"" Linh warned.Abusive behavior on the Internet manifests in a variety of ways, such as stealing personal information, sexual abuse by threatening to post sensitive images, forced sending pornographic images and videos, harassment via texting, cyber-bullying, sending verbal attacks and threats and many others.Abusers often approach children through forums, social networks, or chat rooms, or online games. Then they build trust by praising, caring, giving gifts and money. The abuser often creates sympathy for the child's emotions. When children are off guard, they ask for photos, videos, and sensitivity footage.If children refuse, they threaten to tell their parents, friends or spread the pictures and videos they already have. This stage is often beyond the ability of children to handle.According to Nguyen Thi Nga, deputy director of the Department of Child Affairs, there is currently a legal framework against online child abuse in Vietnam, with fines of up to several tens of millions of dong (VND10 million = $438).There are many ways to prevent children from being abused online, but there is no better way than for parents to build companionship with their children, let them trust and seek support when needed.""Being friends with your child is not easy. Parents shouldn't play the role of questioning 'police', or judging 'court' regarding their child's behavior,"" Linh advised.","Vietnam,online child exploitation,online child abuse,online risks"

Every weekend I go to coffee shops and attend personals skill courses that I like"".When she told him her decision to have only one child, her husband supported it.A newborn baby at Tu Du Hospital in HCMC, January 2021. Photo by VnExpress/Anh ThuAccording to Khuat Thu Hong, director of the Institute for Social Development Studies (ISDS), there are a growing number of couples like Nhung who are putting off having more babies.According to 2020  from the Department of Population and Family Planning, 21 provinces and cities in the country had a fertility rate of fewer thantwo children per woman, accounting for 39 percent of the population.In 2019 the five centrally-run cities, especially Ho Chi Minh City, had among the lowest rates, .""The low birth rate is because of social and economic pressures,"" Hong says.Nguyen Thu Quynh, 30, of Hanoi's Cau Giay District understands more than anyone the economic pressures of living in a large family.""Sometimes I still dream of being called up to the blackboard by my teacher for not paying my tuition fees or being beaten by my mother for asking for a dress that she couldn't afford,"" she says about her childhood memories of growing up in a poor family with many siblings.She does not want the past to repeat itself with her four-year-old daughter.Her family's current income is just over VND20 million ($872) a month.Every month, on top of the VND5 million it takes to raise a child, she still has to pay off her mortgage of VND5 million and send VND2 million to her parents and grandparents.""I am afraid I won't be able to bear the economic burden of having more kids,"" she says.The economic crisis triggered by the Covid-19 pandemic in the last two years has also made couples afraid of having children.In the U.S., a survey by the Guttmacher Institute, a research and policy organization committed to advancing sexual and reproductive health and rights, found that 34 percent of women with husbands or boyfriends have decided to delay pregnancy or have fewer children because of Covid-related economic concerns.A study by Dai-ichi Life Research Institute belonging to the Japanese life insurer also found a similar situation in Japan.Hoang Ngoc Hai, 34, a tour guide living in HCMC's District 1, lost his job due to the pandemic, forcing him to give up the idea of having a second child.His wife, an English teacher, became the main breadwinner of the family, but her income from teaching online has been barely enough to support the entire family. The couple have used up all their savings.""We have just one child but still face financial difficulties, and sometimes even quarrel due to money problems,"" he says.The epidemic has caused Nguyen Thanh Hoa, 30, of HCMC to think not having children is a good idea.The woman who got married five years ago says: ""We have bought a house and currently have a saving of VND300 million. We want to make sure we are financially stable first before having a child"".The couple have been lucky that they were still earning money and comfortably working from home without children around during the four months of stringent lockdowns.Meanwhile, their friends were frantically looking to buy diapers and food and caring for their children while also trying to earn a living.""If having kids makes parents feel exhausted and children face the risk of falling sick due to Covid, air pollution and others, what's the point of having kids?""

Photo by VnExpress/Phan DuongWith people not keen on having kids and the improved healthcare system, people are living longer and the aging population is posing a challenge to the fiscal and macroeconomic stability to many societies.According to data from the United Nations, in 2020 just over 33 percent of the world's population was under the age of 20 compared to 44 percent in 1950.Experts predict that by the second half of this century, or even earlier, the global population will begin a sustained decline for the first time.Many signs of that scenario have emerged around the world: A number of maternity clinics in Italy have closed and schools have been turned into nursing homes, ghost cities are appearing in northeastern China and universities in South Korea cannot find enough students.In Germany, hundreds of thousands of houses have been razed and turned into parks. In Japan, adult diapers outsell baby diapers.Vietnam’s population is aging rapidly.In developed countries, the demographic transition to an aging population took decades, even hundreds of years, but in Vietnam it has taken only 17-20 years.It is forecast that by 2050 Vietnam will become a 'super-old' country with people over 65 years accounting for 18 percent of the population.According to experts, the low fertility rate will be detrimental to socio-economic development by putting increasing pressure on the social welfare system for the elderly and reducing the availability of human resources.Later a child will have to face the burden of taking care of two parents and four grandparents at the same time.It is forecast that after 2035 every four people of working age will have to take care of three people of non-working ages.Faced with the fact that people are afraid to have children, in the last two years the government has changed its policy from encouraging people to have only one child to having two.Prime Minister Pham Minh Chinh has approved a program to encourage both men and women to marry before 30 and have two children.A draft outlineof the  by the Ministry of Health for submission to the government says couples in areas with low birth rates will be encouraged to have two children.The government will grant couples a sum equal to the minimum wage of their region on having their first child and twice that on having a second.The minimum wage currently ranges from VND3.07 million to VND4.42 million, and thus women in some places will receive up to VND8.84 million when they have their second child.But Hai, the tour guide, says even if the law is passed, he and his wife would stop with one child if their income is still precarious.""Raising a child is a long journey. Moreover, raising a child involves many things, not just money"".He and his wife have saved money, planning to give it to their son when he turns 18.He also plans to buy life insurance so that in his old age he will not be a burden for his child.Instead of giving her son a younger sister or brother, Nhung plans to give him as many life skills as possible and a lot of love.The couple have also set up a separate fund for moving into a retirement home in their old age.""We are determined from the very beginning that we will not rely on our children when we were old so that we won't be disappointed later,"" she adds.","Vietnam,fertility rate,birth rate,population,Covid-19,children,babies"
life,trend,Covid forces HCMC conductors to sleep in buses,"Many bus attendants working for Vietnam National University-Ho Chi Minh City (VNUHCM) in Thu Duc City lost their jobs at the end of June when the city stopped bus services to curb the spread of Covid.
Mai Thai Cuong, a 52-year-old from Hanoi, has been living inside a bus since he doesn't have enough money to rent accommodation or return to his hometown. Life in the rural area is difficult, so he moved to the southern metropolis to work as a bus conductor two years ago.
""I thought the Covid resurgence in late April would be stamped out after one month and didn't expect bus services to shut down this long. In the past few months, my colleagues and I have been trying to hold out in these buses,"" he said.Since Cuong lives alone, he only has a few clothes, a mini gas stove, a sleeping mat and a few jugs of water.
He collects rainwater for daily use or purchases some to drink. When there isn’t enough water, he would bathe once every two days.
""Instant noodles and eggs are the dishes I eat the most to help me stay afloat during the month-long lockdown. Now I've gotten tired of eating those. Thankfully, I now have more options to choose from as the city allows takeaway services,"" he said.In the past four days, Cuong and three other bus conductors got jobs as construction workers at a site four kilometers from the bus station.
While waiting for the bus service to resume operation, Cuong said he would take on any seasonal job to earn a living.At 5:30 p.m., after returning home from work, Cuong cleans his ""house"", bus number 53, which usually runs from VNUHCM to Hong Phong Street in District 10.
""I've been hiding from my family that my life here is still fine. My family in the countryside is also poor. Now I am unemployed, I am very sad that I can't send money home to my children,"" he lamented.Similar to Cuong, after work, Thach Cham Pha took advantage of his free time to plant some vegetables to incorporate into his meals.
The 37-year-old of Khmer origin moved from southern Tra Vinh Province to Ho Chi Minh City to earn a living more than 15 years ago. For the first two years, he has done many construction jobs to survive.
""I have a heart condition and can't do heavy work, so I switched to working on a bus. My monthly salary is around VND6 million ($264.34), which is not enough to rent accommodation. So I've been on the bus since before the Covid outbreak broke out,"" he said.Pha's dinner mainly comprises fried leftovers from noon. On the bus, he has installed a rice cooker, fans and blankets.
During the social distancing period, a few other conductors pooled money to buy food, making use of the corner of Pha's kitchen to cook together. They asked a neighbor living near the bus station to let them store food and produce in their refrigerator.After finishing dinner, he takes a shower and washes his clothes at 6:30 p.m.
He pays a household next to the bus station VND50,000 a month to use their water, which he puts in buckets and carries back to use for bathing and washing, and VND100,000 per month to share their electricity bill.
To cook and drink, he has to collect rainwater or buy bottled water.""Every day, I only dare to spend about VND50,000. I also have to save money to buy medicine. In the past few months, I have been supported with some food by donors.
""If bus services won't resume operation soon, I don't think I could hold out much longer with such little savings left,"" he said.Opposite to Pha's bus is the ""home"" of Tran Phu Quy and his son.
Two weeks ago, he picked up his youngest four-year-old from Long Thanh District, Dong Nai Province, to feel less lonely.
Quy has two children, the oldest is 12 and lives in the countryside with his grandparents in Dong Thap Province. His wife works at a factory in Dong Nai and raises the youngest child. Due to the nature of their work, Quy and his wife have to stay far from each other.
In the evening, he often hangs out in a hammock with his son to watch something on the phone together or call his wife.
The cooking is done in Pha's kitchen.
""My son likes to live in the bus station because he can run around everywhere. So he doesn't want to go home. During the five years of doing this job, I have never thought I would be living and sleeping in a bus one day. But I'm used to it now,"" the 41-year-old confirmed.Since the inside of the bus is stuffy, conductors often go to the park nearby to relax or go for a walk.
When night falls, they often sit and drink tea and chat around a homemade wheeled table.""Life here is very boring. If it rains, I will go to sleep early at 9 p.m.,"" Pha said.
""This bus is old and can't close all its doors all the way, so mosquitoes come in a lot, meaning I have to sleep under a net.""Quy sleeps on the floor and lets his son sleep on the hammock. Since his bus is new, the doors can fully close so there is no need for a net.
He hopes bus services would be allowed to operate again soon and be as crowded as before in order for him to have money to pay a debt of VND20 million.
Nguyen Vinh Tung, manager of the bus station of VNUHCM, said there are about 80 buses parked here and nearly 50 drivers and conductors staying here due to the epidemic. Most of the stranded people rent a motel room near the bus station, while more than 10 people are allowed to stay on the bus due to poor circumstances.
""Recently, the bus station also gave each driver and conductor VND1 million. Some also received additional state relief packages and food support,"" Tung said.
From Oct. 4, Ho Chi Minh City reopened four bus routes operating in Can Gio District. On Oct. 25, another four routes would be allowed to resume service, with frequency and operating time depending on the situation and actual needs of each area.","Vietnam,bus station,bus line,bus attendants,HCMC"

Photo by VnExpress/Quynh TranA report published in The Lancet Psychiatry journal in the U.K. in April analyzed the health records of 236,379 recovered Covid patients, mostly in the U.S. and found 34 percent had been diagnosed with neurological or psychiatric illnesses within six months of recovery, suggesting the pandemic could lead to a wave of mental and neurological problems.For many people the mental health sequelae is due to the fact they have witnessed first-hand the death of fellow patients or even loved ones while in hospital.In Binh Tan District, Nguyen Van Hai, 63, was discharged from a hospital after nearly a month. But his 59-year-old wife could not make it.Nguyen Thi Thu Hang, his daughter, says: ""He cried almost every day and did not want to eat. Whenever he heard ambulance sirens he panicked and sometimes screamed"".After returning home her father stayed in his room for days and did not talk to other family members, she says.""The doctor later gave him tranquilizers to help him sleep better"".Tri Thi Minh Thuy, a volunteer and psychotherapist from the Ho Chi Minh City University of Social Sciences and Humanities who provides counseling and mental health support to patients at the hospital, says the most unfortunate are those who lost loved ones to Covid, which drives them to the point of mental breakdown.In Hoc Mon, Vi’s mother has also experienced post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) after being discharged from a field hospital.""My mother was on a ventilator for weeks, and everyone around her in that hospital room faced the same breathing issue. She is now afraid of looking at photos or videos of Covid-19 patients with ventilators"".According to the Cho Ray Hospital survey, the chances of having mental health problems increased for patients who had to be on oxygen support or ventilators, with nearly 67 percent experiencing depression and anxiety disorders.Mental issues can also flare up as Covid survivors face stigma and distrust from neighbors, friends and even strangers, especially when they still have persistent cough or shortness of breath, provoking fear in others.""My housemates are polite but I know they try to avoid me when I use the shared kitchen, and my boss told me not to return to office when it reopened in early Oct.,"" Le Thanh Phuong, a Covid survivor who tested negative for the coronavirus in Sept, says.Nguyen Huyen Mai of Dong Nai’s Bien Hoa Town says she could ""obviously see that people are cautious around me.""That makes me feel like I am a danger or a shame that must be shunned even though my doctor told me I do not need to be in quarantine any more.""A recovered Covid patient in Hanoi, May 2021. Photo by VnExpress/Ngoc ThanhAnother factor is that sickness and symptoms persist even after patients recover and test negative. This makes many people anxious and panicky, and they find it difficult to resume their daily life.""My children still have some fatigue and cough,"" Vi says, and she worries their breathing might deteriorate overnight.""That’s why I cannot sleep, I cannot help checking on them all night.""Natalie Lambert, a health researcher at the Indiana University School of Medicine in the U.S., surveyed more than 1,500 patients having long Covid through the Survivor Corps Facebook page last year and found that anxiety was the eighth most common symptom, with more than 700 respondents suffering from it, according to the newspaper.Taking care of Covid survivors’ mental health has received attention in the last few months.Apart from support from their families and friends, many recovered Covid patients have formed online groups to share their recovery experiences.Facebook group ‘F0 Khong Co Don’ (Covid Patients Are Not Alone) with more than 88,000 members is one of those.In HCMC, the disease epicenter, a mental health program called ‘Vaccine For The Mind’ was launched to provide counseling for people with anxiety, stress and other psychological issues, especially recovered Covid patients.To rehabilitate people after Covid , the program will help them find resources to help themselves through information about jobs, self-development and learning.The HCMC Psychiatric Hospital has also set up a team of medics to help Covid patients.To get rid of insomnia and anxiety, Vi has sought professional support and slowly got better. But her mother, who has refused to talk to doctors and others, is still dealing with PTSD.Last weekend she took her mother to church for Sunday mass for the first time since the outbreak resurfaced in May.""When we returned home, my mother got angry and cried, saying she did not feel confident being around strangers"".But Vi is not giving up, she will keep encouraging her mother to go out and get used to the new normal.","Covid,patients,pandemic,mental health"
life,what-makes-learning-english-at-an-international-school-different-4374558.html,What makes learning English at an international school different,"In many Vietnamese public schools and English centers, students often learn English as a foreign language to use at the workplace with very limited language purpose, or to take language certification exams like TOEIC, IELTS, or TOEFL.At The International School @ ParkCity Hanoi (ISPH), students learn English to use as their primary language in communicating with teachers and friends in class and as a tool for learning and acquiring knowledge in subjects like math, sciences, music, art, and PE, as well as conduct research and self-study.ISPH primary students attend a math lesson. Photo courtesy of ISPHRik Millington, principal of ISPH, said a student for whom English is not a first language will usually take about a year to develop communicative English and around three years to master his/her academic English; to write reports and essays, make presentations, study specialized subject textbooks. Therefore, if the student only focuses on communication and learning grammar, their academic English ability would not be significantly improved as it does not have a ‘real world’ application.English at international schools is taught in all subjects, and is the common language used in all school activities and events. Therefore, students have an environment to practice and use English regularly, helping them to naturally improve their English ability and make much more rapid progress.ISPH students engage in a self-study lesson inside the school library. Photo courtesy of ISPHJames Ellis, an English teacher at ISPH shared that English at school is taught in different ways suitable to each group of students. For students in pre- and primary school, teachers will focus on vocabulary, pronunciation, phonics, sentence structure, grammar, and critical thinking in English.For secondary school students, especially those studying the IGCSE programme, English is taught more intensively and comprehensively, focusing on word usage, content creation, learning about different types of literary genres, writing styles, the meaning the author wants to convey in each literary work, as well as analyzing the work.According to Ellis, English taught at international schools is more applicable because it is linked to other subjects to create opportunities for students to practice and apply new knowledge in a real-life manner.For example, when students study a 'Superheroes' topic, they not only learn about the work but are also asked to create their own hero character in the form of writing or artwork. Through this activity, vocabulary related to this topic in other subjects like creative arts or physics are also introduced to students, creating opportunities for them to use those new words more often in school.Studying in an international environment with teachers and students from many different countries around the world forces students to use English for daily communication and as a tool to acquire knowledge in all subjects.Nhat Minh, a year 10 student at ISPH said English here is taught in a natural manner; students are learning English not only through lessons but through playing, exercising and communicating. In addition, the teachers at ISPH are also very friendly, enthusiastic and caring. They always encourage students to ask questions and are happy to answer them to make sure all students understand a topic before moving to a new one. This makes the ISPH learning environment friendlier and happier, helping students achieve better results.ISPH Secondary students in a science lesson. Photo courtesy of ISPHBao Khue, a student who joined ISPH at the beginning of this school year, can speak English freely here without being afraid of her friends not understanding what she means or thinking she's bragging about her English skills.""At ISPH, I get to learn about plays and novels in English lessons instead of just learning grammar and vocabulary like in my old school, which is way more interesting for me,"" Khue said.In addition to curricular subjects, students at international schools are often encouraged to participate in a variety of extracurricular activities and are provided opportunities to develop leadership and life skills.Therefore, the English they learn at school is a practical language that covers all aspects of life, helping them freely communicate, express personal views and acquire new knowledge in English as well as learn a new language.ISPH students perform Broadway musical Annie JR. Photo courtesy of ISPHStudying in an international school, apart from learning new knowledge, students also learn the way to use language and think like native speakers. They are exposed to many different cultures and accents that help them develop skills and the ability to appropriately communicate and react in a multinational environment. For these reasons, students graduating from international schools can attend any university and college around the world. They are able to confidently study abroad and achieve high results without any language and cultural barriers or differences in thinking, and with greater ability to self-study compared to native speakers.The International School @ ParkCity Hanoi (ISPH)ParkCity Hanoi, Le Trong Tan, Ha Dong, Hanoi| info@isph.edu.vn | +84 93 44 55 228","learning English,international school,ISPH"
life,trend,Hanoians on life in a flood-prone village,"It was still raining heavily in Bui Xa Village at noon on Oct. 18.After her trip to the market, Nguyen Thi Thanh and her daughter-in-law parked their motorbike at a lot in the middle of the village, put on their boots and waded home more than 500 meters away.The floodwater level rose higher and higher, reaching Thanh's knees, as she moved further into the village.Since she's a food seller at the local traditional market, Thanh has to get up before 2 a.m. daily to receive goods from merchants. On rainy days, fearing trouble when wading through flooded roads at night, she would stay and sleep at her second son's house near the entrance of the village and return home at noon the next day.Thanh's home and about 100 households in Bui Xa Village of Chuong My District are situated near Bui River.The right side of the river is defined as a flood-prone area since it helps divert floodwater from Red River and Day River to protect central Hanoi. As a result, Chuong My is flooded every year.Due to the  triggering heavy rains and floods in , Hanoi and northern Hoa Binh Province witnessed massive downpours since Oct. 16.The heavy rain and upstream water flow from Hoa Binh have caused the water level of Bui River to rise. Some rural transport routes in the communes of Chuong My District were also flooded and more than 190 houses submerged 0.3-1.2 meters.The main alley leading to Bui Xa Village is flooded on Oct. 18, 2021. Photo by VnExpress/Pham NgaThe main alley leading to Bui Xa saw floodwaters reach 0.5 meters, entering low-lying yards and houses situated by the riverside.The rising water level has upended the daily life of people in Bui Xa.When she saw floodwaters entering her yard while having lunch, Thanh quickly called her husband and children to take their clothes out of the wardrobe and put them somewhere higher, bringing their two big dogs and some puppies inside the family's two-story house.""Our family has to let the dogs urinate and defecate on the floor and clean up afterward since there is no other way,"" she said.After luring in the dogs, the pigsty was flooded and caused the pregnant sow to squeal. So Thanh and her husband put on conical hats to lure them to higher ground, taking a piece of corrugated iron to cover them temporarily.Her son carried out the aluminum boat in the warehouse and tied it in front of the house just in case. Around noon, the floodwaters had already reached a bit over Thanh's heels.""This year the water rose slowly,"" she said. ""Back in 2018, I took a little nap but when I opened my eyes the water already reached as high as the bed. At the time, soldiers had to come in to help me clean up and my whole family moved into the house of my second son.""Nguyen Dinh Hoa, chairman of Chuong My District, said the government has directed commune to coordinate with local military units to prepare means of evacuating people when the water rises to a dangerous level.The flood scene at Nguyen Thi Toi's house is no different from Thanh's house.The 45-year-old woman and her husband carried two wardrobes and an old refrigerator to the upper floor. At noon on Oct. 18, when the floodwater receded in other areas in the village, her kitchen was still inundated.""During the dry season, I can still grow some crops on the field. But I can't do so during the rainy season,"" said Tam, her husband, pointing at the flooded papaya tree in front of his house.According to the latest report on Chuong My District, nearly 300 hectares of winter crops in the district were completely or partially flooded.But according to Tam, the heavy rain in 2018 was much worse. That year, when he had just finished harvesting rice, the village received heavy downpours, with floodwater reaching up to his back. The couple carried each bag of soaked rice on their boat, pushing it to a few houses near the entrance of the village to dry temporarily.Standing in the middle of the flooded road leading to her house, Hoang Thi Sim, 63, was trying to remove dirt and cement with a bucket normally used to store rainwater.Her house is under construction, and its water system has not yet been installed. ""Every day, I go to my neighbors to ask them for some clean water for daily usage. But I can't visit them since it is hard to bring the clean water back along the flooded road,"" she said.Saving clean water is the first solution for people in Bui Xa to adapt to flooding.Sim said she had purchased a bottle of itching medicine.""I put it on every night, but my feet are still sore,"" she said, showing her white foot, affected from being submerged in water for a long time.Living in a flood-prone area, Bui Xa villagers have actively found solutions to adapt to living conditions. For example, residents always build houses 0.5 to 1 meter higher than the road surface. Most households have a boat ready to use when needed.Every time the water rises, the commune loudspeakers of Bui Xa start to remind people to pack their belongings in case of severe floods, and to evacuate children and the elderly from heavily flooded areas.In September 2020, officials of Chuong My District said to ensure that people do not have to suffer from flooding, the best option is to migrate residents out of the flood-prone area.Chuong My District has proposed that Hanoi prioritizes strengthening and upgrading the Bui River dike system.During this flood, Thanh's two grandchildren and dozens of young kids in the area were pushed by their parents on a boat to a relative's house to stay temporarily. Her neighbors had to evacuate the whole family to another place, to wait until the flood recedes.People wade through a flooded area in Bui Xa Village. Photo by VnExpress/Ha Huy DatTo avoid the situation of rice being soaked in rainwater, Toi and her husband finished harvesting and transported their crop directly to their grandmother's house, located more than a kilometer away. They only plant rice once a year and harvest it by June just before the annual flooding season begins, which usually comes in late July or early August and remains until November or even after.Most locals have simply accepted living with floods.Toi only wishes to be healthy, and have money to build a house higher than the usual floodwater level. Meanwhile, Thanh said that many acquaintances who saw her wading through water twice a day to the market advised her to sell her house and move to another place.She said she doesn't plan to relocate. ""I have to adapt to where I live.""","Vietnam,flooding,heavy rains,Bui Xa Village,Hanoi"

Staying at home and having conflicts with family members in the last few months of the Covid-19 lockdown, she yearned for something that could help her find peace of mind.""This class was free, so I gave it a try,"" the 30-year-old, a resident of Cau Giay District in Hanoi, said.At the same time, on the third floor of a house in Dong Da District, Nguyen Thuy Dung, Ngoc’s friend, was also waiting for the meditation session to begin.It would be the third meditation class for Dung in the last year. The IT worker wants to get over a past relationship.By 8:30 p.m. the class had nearly 200 attendees. All of them turned off their cameras and microphones, listening to the meditator’s guidance.The class was organized by Minh Dao, 28, a writer who has been practicing meditation for six years. He has started the class ""as a gift for everyone amid Covid-19.""The Cambridge dictionary defines meditation as ""the act of giving your attention to only one thing, either as a religious activity or as a way of becoming calm and relaxed.""Nguyen Cao Minh, a lecturer at the Vietnam National University in Hanoi’s University of Education who is highly trained in using mindfulness and meditation to address psychological problems, said meditation could simply be understood as focusing on the present moment and accepting everything that is happening, including thoughts and feelings without judgment.In Vietnam, meditation has long been popular since it has spiritual and cultural underpinnings.But it is becoming increasingly popular among young people.Minh said: ""In the past people were often interested in meditation when they were 40-45 years old. Now this age range is much lower, mainly 30 and below.""Dao estimated that 80 percent of people in his meditation class are 18-35 years old. Huynh Nguyen, owner of a meditation studio on Hanoi’s Nguyen Du Street for the last three years, has also noticed a reduction in practitioners’ ages.Huynh Nguyen during a meditation session in 2020. Photo courtesy of Huynh""The largest number of them are from 22 to 40 years old.""Young Vietnamese often know about meditation classes via the Internet.Once while surfing social networks, Dung typed the word ""meditation,"" and got information about Dao and Nguyen’s classes. Some people like Ngoc learned from friends.Why are young people attracted to meditation more than before? Minh listed two main reasons: to develop themselves and to deal with stress.Both these needs are high among young people, especially the latter, he said.Compared to previous generations, young people now are more interested in mental health, and actively seek ways to prevent and mitigate mental issues, he said.Nguyen said his students often face problems such as stress, fatigue and insomnia.Dao said most of his students experience ""negative thoughts and emotions.""""The inner lives of young people are being ravaged by social networks not to mention the fact that the recent lockdown gave them time to look at themselves and realize that their problems are not always caused by the outside world, but also by their inner self.""Meditation has been accessible and affordable in Vietnam in the last few years. A five-week basic meditation course offered by Nguyen costs less than VND2 million ($86.2). During the pandemic, he has organized classes online, allowing participants to pay based on what they want.Dao does not charge any fees.Huynh Nguyen (sitting, 2nd left) and his students at a meditation class before the recent lockdown in Hanoi. Photo courtesy of HuynhMeditation classes must be carefully and logically designed so that learners can feel comfortable.""Depressed people already have negative thoughts; we don't want them to feel worse,"" Minh said.Experts said meditation is not a panacea for all psychological problems, warning that for people with paranoid or psychotic disorders, it could even be dangerous.Minh said: ""When we practice meditation, we turn inward, develop faith in our experience. If ones do it incorrectly, they should not do it.""But, in general, meditation helps relieve stress and understand oneself better, and so is useful for almost everyone.Dao and Nguyen said meditation gives young people more tools to live peacefully and ""touch their emotions"".After Dao's mediation sessions, some participants have shared they burst into tears when they remembered bad events and connected with their past.Ngoc is not familiar with meditation, and said she would attend one more session to see how it goes.Dung feels at peace. She will continue to attend meditation classes, because she sees it as an opportunity to sort through chaotic thoughts and heal the spirit.""Meditation is very difficult. Reading books and listening to lectures from others are only the start,"" Minh concluded.Ultimately, individuals must listen to themselves, develop faith in their own experiences and understand the nature of meditation.""","Vietnam,Vietnamese youth,mediation,mental health,Covid-19"

They rent a room of less than nine-square-meters in an alley on 9th Street in Thu Duc's Linh Xuan Ward.Their room is made with corrugated roofing and has a loft, toilet and shower area. The floor is a few centimeters higher than the outside path.""The room is 2.4 meters wide and 3.6 meters long. The total floor area is 8.64 square meters including the toilet,"" Phu said after pulling out measuring tape.Duc Phu takes care of his three-year-old daughter while waiting for his wife to return from the factory. Photo by VnExpress/Le TuyetAt the end of the room is the cooking area. On the small table, there is a mini gas stove, a bottle of fish sauce and a pack of salt. Underneath is a plastic bucket containing rice and a bag with instant noodles and vegetables hung up to save space.The couple have repeatedly discussed buying a refrigerator, a washing machine or a wardrobe. But they stopped because there is no space.In February, their three-year-old daughter was crying because the room was too hot, forcing them to install an air conditioner since ""it doesn't take up space when hanging on the wall.""After leaving Mekong Delta ten years ago to settle in the city, the couple's total monthly income is about VND13 million (around $572). But they only have around VND4 million left after paying VND2 million for child care, VND150,000 per day for food and drink, and VND2.4 million in vehicle loans.With such little savings, the family cannot afford anything bigger than their current room, which costs nearly VND1.3 million per month, including electricity and water.""The room is small, but does not flood during high tide. The landlord is kind enough to let us delay our rent when we can't pay on time,"" Phu said.Compared to Thuong's house, the room rented by Kim Chi on Bo Song Street, Tan Tao A Ward, Binh Tan District, is only a bit over three square meters, costing around VND500,000 in rent.To save money, she shares a room with a colleague. In nearly six years of working at Taiwanese footwear maker Pouyuen Vietnam, including overtime, her monthly income is around VND8 million.""I want to save money, so I spend it sparingly. I make sure rent does not exceed 15 percent of my salary,"" the 29-year-old said.Chi lives in a boarding house that has about 80 rooms with nearly 200 people.During the four-month long social distancing period, there were many Covid cross infections in her neighborhood, so Chi remained inside her room. Whenever she craved outdoor air, she has to wait for the surrounding rooms to close their doors and windows before she dares go out.""At the time, I just wanted to get on a motorbike and go straight to my hometown in the Mekong Delta City of Can Tho,"" she said. ""The feeling of being trapped was very scary.""Kim Chi watches TV in her rented room in Binh Tan District. Photo by VnExpress/Le TuyetThu and Chi are two of over  in an average space per capita of less than three square meters.According to a survey by the Ho Chi Minh City Federation of Labor on workers' housing needs conducted at the end of last year, 70 percent of the workforce in the city are migrants, of which 50 percent need accommodation, corresponding to 1.3 million people.Of these, nearly 40,000 workers (accounting for 3 percent) live in accommodation and dormitories built in industrial zones. Most laborers live in boarding houses built and leased by households and individuals.The average area of each room is about 14 square meters with an average rent of VND1.6 million per month, with each room containing four people. Others renting rooms each month must pay between VND2-3 million. Workers spend 10-15 percent of their income to pay for accommodation.According to Vice Chairman of the Federation of Labor Pham Chi Tam, if compared with the provisions of the Law on Residence, the minimum housing area as a condition for permanent residence registration must not be lower than an eight-square-meter floor area per person. Many enterprise facilities don't meet that requirement.Workers live in cramped rooms, while many places do not ensure the minimum conditions of hygiene, electricity, water and labor productivity.Before the Covid-19 outbreak, the city's 17 export processing zones, industrial parks and high-tech zones had more than 320,000 workers, more than half of whom were migrants in need of accommodation.Huynh Van Tuan, chairman of the trade union affiliated to HCMC Export Processing Zone and Industrial Park Authority (HEPZA), said with an average monthly income of about VND7 million, many workers struggle to save, which makes it difficult for them to buy houses or rent spacious rooms. Housing projects for workers are also quite meager.According to data from the HCMC Department of Construction, in the 2016-2020 period, the city had developed more than 1.2 million square meters of social housing, serving more than 66,000 people. Among 19 projects with nearly 15,000 apartments, the highest appraised construction investment value was 15.5 million per square meter; with each project featuring more than 750 rooms.""When there is no stable place to live, workers are willing to move if they find a cheaper place or even leave the city to return to their hometown, negatively affecting the labor force,"" Tuan said.A dormitory of workers on the 9th street, Linh Xuan Ward, Thu Duc City. Photo by VnExpress/Le TuyetTran Viet Anh, vice chairman of HCMC Union of Business Association, said at the beginning of September, 300 enterprises surveyed the labor situation to prepare for production when the city reopened.Accordingly, only 40 percent of workers who had relocated to their hometown want to return, with others waiting for the Lunar New Year to pass before heading back to the city.One reason that affects worker psychology is accommodation. Many boarding rooms are only 10 square meter but 10 people squeeze together to live inside.According to Viet Anh, workers were divided into day and night shifts before the pandemic. But then during the four months of social distancing, all had to stay at home full time, so living space was narrow, and many problems occurred. They also saw many Covid patients living in the same boarding house leave and never return.Living in that cramped environment, many workers are tired and worried and just want to return to their hometown for safety.After the fourth Covid wave hit Vietnam in late April, nearly 600,000 people left HCMC for their hometown, in many cases due to long-term job loss and no money for rent.Recently, Chairman of Ho Chi Minh City People's Committee Phan Van Mai said it would build one million affordable houses to replace old apartments, houses on canals and boarding houses for workers and low-income residents.Mai encouraged workers to return to contribute to the construction and development of the city and admits that investment in their care could be better.","Vietnam,HCMC,industrial hub,migrant workers,accommodation,affordable housing"
life,trend,Hanoi sees mad rush down wedding aisle as Covid restrictions ease,"At midnight Phan Huyen received a phone call from a woman who wanted to organize a wedding two days later.Having worked as a wedding planner for nearly 10 years with a company on Hoang Cau Street, Huyen is no stranger to urgent phone calls from clients.But she has never received more than 20 calls in a day until now.She had to refuse the woman because her schedule was full, and the customer had not prepared anything.She said: ""She had to postpone the wedding to December. Not only our company, but all others are overloaded"".On July 18, the Hanoi People's Committee urged people not to hold weddings as Covid resurfaced. On July 24 the city imposed Directive 16, stopping all non-essential services. Two months later, on Sept. 21, the lockdown was eased and many activities and services were allowed again.Many couples choose to get married in October, 2021. Photo courtesy of Thuyen Giay Wedding & Event PlannerIn October, as more and more couples rush to get married, people in the wedding industry say they are witnessing a ""storm"".Weddings and engagement ceremonies have been mostly scheduled on Oct. 15 and 24, the two most auspicious days of the year in the lunar calendar. On October 15 Huyen was in charge of five weddings and had to work from 5 a.m. to midnight.Duong Bich Hang, owner of a wedding planning company on Hanoi’s Hao Nam Street, had more than 20 marriages in October.On Oct. 24, she will have nearly 30. ""It feels like the whole of Hanoi is getting married on Oct. 15 and 24,"" she said happily.It is not really as if the number of people getting married is more than in previous years; it is just that the pandemic has narrowed the number of auspicious days.Many couples had to postpone their weddings due to the lockdowns, and are scrambling to get married as soon as possible lest another outbreak begins. Some have been waiting to gauge the pandemic situation and so only decide to organize weddings at very short notice.""The problem is that wedding services are not like selling clothes,"" Hang said, explaining, ""It consists of countless stages, and each company is different"".A wedding takes four days to prepare for on average, and could take 10 if the bride and groom are choosy.Most weddings put pressure on all involved, including brides, grooms, their families, and organizers.Tran Lan Huong, 29, of Cau Giay District was planning to marry on Oct. 15 before deciding to cancel it when Hanoi was in lockdown in July.In early October, seeing that the pandemic situation was better, she contacted her wedding planner again and chose to get married on Oct. 15.""Fortunately, they still prioritized me,"" she said.The wedding went smoothly, but Huong was upset because she could not stitch an and had to wear an old dress instead.The huge demand for professionals meant she had to do her own makeup and her brother had to take photos.""I will definitely regret (not having nice photos) in future,"" she said.An employee of a wedding planning company decorates a backdrop for a wedding in Hanoi, October, 2021. Photo courtesy of Song Anh Wedding & EventsMany are also in a hurry to marry due to pressure from their family.On Oct.18, Nguyen Huyen My’s parents told her to get married on an auspicious day this month though she was not ready.""I cried for two days because I could not lose weight in such a short period of time,"" the woman living in Dong Da District said. Her goal had been to lose 10 kg to wear a pretty wedding dress.Huyen said: ""Brides and grooms, especially brides, normally think since they will only get married once everything should be perfect. But parents prioritize auspicious days, causing conflicts"".For the last two weeks Hang and her staff have worked from 3 a.m. to evening every day, sometimes staying up all night to iron clothes, wash dishes, prepareflowers, and design backdrops, arrange tables and chairs.Hang also has to seek forgiveness from clients if her staff go to their houses for decoration earlier or later than scheduled.Though these businesses and other service providers’ revenues were hit by the pandemic, they try to keep the same prices and ensure quality, often by limiting the number of customers they take on.Brides and grooms’ families and service providers are forced to adapt to pandemic needs.For instance, many organize an engagement ceremony and welcome the bride to the husband’s home just once, instead of having two different ceremonies.Parties are also smaller and more intimate.For a wedding ceremony on Oct. 19, Le Huong Giang, 28, of Ba Dinh District reduced the number of guests by 90 percent from her original plan. She spent money improving the food and drinks, flowers and makeup. The party had performances by the bride and groom and their friends.Huyen said: ""No ‘diplomatic’ guests, everyone was comfortable and the wedding was more meaningful. This will probably be the trend of future weddings"".To reduce the pressure, consultants advise couples to decide on the wedding as soon as possible to get more time to prepare. They are also recommended to specify the budget and standards to quickly select suppliers, and hire professional wedding organizers if they do not have time for preparations.Many people are also opting not to get caught in the ""storm"".After five years of a long-distance relationship while she was studying abroad, Nguyen Van Anh, 30, thought that she would get married soon after returning to Vietnam, but has instead decided to postpone the plan indefinitely.Her house and her boyfriend’s are in Covid hotspots Van Mieu and Van Chuong wards.Anh is not sure when she will get married, but for her, the top priority is everyone's safety and comfort.""An auspicious day is a day without the pandemic,"" she said.""Moreover, our love is what determines everything.""","couple,wedding,family,young people,Covid-19,pandemic,Hanoi"

But after 30 minutes, she had failed to sell any and hopped on her bicycle to relocate.In Mekong Delta provinces, lottery ticket sellers who have been vaccinated are allowed to operate again. However, in Ho Chi Minh City, lottery tickets are only sold by retailers.""I know I am not allowed to do so and there is still a risk of infection, but I hoped to earn some money to buy food,"" she said.Tran Thi Le stands on one side of Le Van Viet Street, Thu Duc City, to sell lottery tickets, Oct. 21, 2021.

Lottery firms in Binh Duong, Vinh Long and Tra Vinh provinces draw their first prize Friday and HCMC, on Saturday.Le and her two children remained in HCMC during the stormy days of the Covid-19 pandemic. With little savings, her family survived the semi lockdown on rice and charitable food donations.Her landlord agreed to reduce rent by half during the month-long social distancing period, but started charging the full rate since the beginning of this month. Although her family had thrice received the city subsidy, it didn’t last long.Hearing the news that the lottery would resume, Le was so happy she couldn't sleep. Even though she had been fully vaccinated, three days ago, she still went to the hospital near her home to get tested for Covid, thinking she would be able to go out selling lottery tickets again with both documents in hand.But she found the reopening only applied to retailers. After some thinking, she decided to take 150 tickets, way less than the normal amount, and sneak outside.""Many of my friends have not dared sell lottery tickets for fear of cross infection. But I risked doing so and hope things don't go south.""Lottery ticket sellers are classified among the four groups most affected by the pandemic.

life,trend,Vietnamese queue overnight for new iPhone,"In Ho Chi Minh City, a number of stores like FPT Shop, Minh Tuan Mobile and Mobile Viet began selling the new Apple's iPhone at midnight Thursday. Meanwhile, resellers like Mobile World and CellphoneS handed pre-ordered phones to customers Friday morning.
Everyone waiting to pick up their iPhone 13 at midnight wore masks and kept a safe social distance.People wait outside a store. The 13 Pro Max has accounted for more than 60 percent of orders, while the cheapest version, the iPhone 13 mini, only accounted for about 3 percent. Distributors said due to the large number of people coming to pick up their pre-orders, stores did not have enough goods to hand out.Customers check the device, and wait to activate their phones.
Due to social distancing regulations, many stores have adopted fast delivery services.Retailers said that their employees are all vaccinated and fully equipped with masks and disinfectants to serve customers.Phone resellers in Hanoi began to deliver the new iPhones to those who pre-ordered on Friday morning.Some stores, like Top Zone of Mobile World, sell Apple products only. These stores are designed and have counters installed by Apple, but doperated by domestic dealers.Huong, a Tay Ho District resident in Hanoi, traveled more than 10 kilometersto pick up her new iPhone. She said she changed her phone once a year.Tuan Anh, a representative of Mono Store, said his chain received about 15,000 new iPhone pre-orders and would hand out the first 1,000 devices to customers Friday. Clients will receive an appointment time to receive their devices on time to avoid crowding.A customer in Hanoi's Dong Da District bought four iPhone 13 Pro Max, but only received three due to supply limitations.
According to the new regulations from authorized Apple resellers, the newly bought iPhone 13 will be unboxed and activated right at the store. Dealers explained this approach serves to limit users buying and reselling their brand new phones at a higher price, and at the same time, reduce the return of faulty devices.
""Unboxing right at the store is inconvenient, because I don't intend to use it right away. However, when I opened it, the devices were not faulty, I am somewhat more assured,"" this person said.","Vietnam,iPhone 13,authorized Apple distributors,Apple"

But two Septembers have come and gone, and she is still at home.""Waiting without an exact return date makes me feel really unsettled,"" she said.Nguyen My Duyen during a hike in Guilin City, China's Guangxi Province. Photo courtesy of DuyenNguyen Thi Hai of Hanoi's Hoai Duc District has recently begun her second year in International Economics and Trade at the Zhejiang Sci-Tech University in Zhejiang Province. She was granted a partial scholarship from the Chinese government last year. She has never attended in-person classes and has only been studying online.Hai has lessons on Mondays, Tuesdays and Fridays. Classes begin at 7 a.m. every day and end at around noon. Her class has 40 students, only five of whom are learning remotely.Hai says the two years have been a struggle. There are days she finds it difficult to log back into the online class because of bad Internet connections. And even if she manages to log back, she has no idea what the professor was talking about. She said some professors have refused to email students the power points used, so she has to ask a friend to film the lecture and email her afterward.""When I listen to the video, it doesn't seem clear and is difficult to comprehend. I have to continuously text and ask the teacher, but I'm worried about asking too many questions...,"" Hai said.With just online classes, Hai has a hard time keeping up with friends and feels she still has not gained much knowledge even though she is already in her second year. But she can’t bear to give up and start again at another university because it would be a colossal waste of time.Nguyen Thi Hai. Photo courtesy of HaiInternational students like Duyen and Hai have been unable to attend in-person classes after China closed its borders to most foreigners from March 2020 to curb the spread of the coronavirus.Last August, China restarted issuing visas for South Korean students, who make up the largest number (10 percent) of all international students in the country. Meanwhile the majority of international students from developing countries have not received any information about their return. In February, thousands of Indian medical students staged a protest on social media, with the hashtag #TakeUsBackToChina.Tran Ngoc Duy, who is taking online classes for his master's degree in Chinese Teaching at Yantai University in Shandong Province, said international students have suffered ""many deadlocks and interruptions,"" because of the pandemic.Duy is the admin of an online group of international students studying abroad in China, which has around 54,000 members.Adding to the worries and frustrations of foreign students was recent information that China's Ministry of Education and universities was planning not to support online learning with scholarship funds.Some schools have also said they find it difficult to organize online classes because they do not find them effective.Duyen (pink jacket, second from right, top row) and Vietnamese students at a cultural event at Fuzhou University, China's Fujian Province, November 2019. Photo courtesy of DuyenMany students have been forced to put their academic programs on hold since they are struggling financially to cover living expenses while paying full tuition fees.Online learning has also meant that some subjects have not been taught yet, and Duyen said this is affecting her chance to retain her scholarship. Each term, the school reviews a student’s academic performance and in order to retain her scholarships, Duyen can only have two subjects with less than 80 percent scores.In September, when she began the first semester of her second year, Duyen received an email from the school, suggesting that international students reserve their seats with the current program, but temporarily suspend their studies till the pandemic situation stabilizes and they can return. She did so without hesitation.When she was in China, Duyen studied materials in both Chinese and English. But after returning to Vietnam, she has not been able to find the books that her lecturers suggest. After reserving her seat and suspending classes, Duyen has begun working part-time for a Taiwanese website, teaching Vietnamese online to earn an income.Duyen’s case is not an exception, Duy said.Results from a quick survey in his online group show that of about 60 participants, five students had temporarily suspended their academic program, three had dropped out and the rest were studying online.Most students said they have ""ineffective"" lessons and have ""extremely frustrating"" experiences because of poor internet connections, lack of practice and interaction with peers.Some students have actually given up their scholarships and looked to continue their education in Vietnam.Pham Phuong Thao won a Chinese government scholarship this year to study marketing at the China University of Petroleum in Shandong Province. She wanted to experience a new learning environment and meet people from different cultures, an important factor in deciding to study abroad.She spent a week deciding between studying temporarily at a school in the countryside while studying online in China or giving up her scholarship and returning to Hanoi.""Instead of living with the uncertainty of returning to China, I can complete my studies in Vietnam. Online learning is not suitable for me, so I gave up the scholarship,"" she explained.Thao is a student majoring in Chinese at Thang Long University now. Since she scored 6 points in the Hanyu Shuiping Kaoshi (HSK), a Chinese proficiency test, she was able to advance to the second year.China currently ranks third in the world for the number of international students after the U.S. and the U.K.According to December 2020 statistics compiled by Chinese social network Tencent, Vietnam has 13,549 international students in China, the fifth-largest contingent after South Korea, the U.S., Japan and Thailand.The Chinese government said in July that it always valued international students and would consider ""synchronous"" arrangements for their return to China in keeping with pandemic-related safety requirements.Since there has been no mention of possible dates mentioned, Vietnamese students of Chinese universities continue to remain in limbo.","Vietnam,Vietnamese international students,education,Covid-19"

On rainy days, fearing trouble when wading through flooded roads at night, she would stay and sleep at her second son's house near the entrance of the village and return home at noon the next day.Thanh's home and about 100 households in Bui Xa Village of Chuong My District are situated near Bui River.The right side of the river is defined as a flood-prone area since it helps divert floodwater from Red River and Day River to protect central Hanoi. As a result, Chuong My is flooded every year.Due to the  triggering heavy rains and floods in , Hanoi and northern Hoa Binh Province witnessed massive downpours since Oct. 16.The heavy rain and upstream water flow from Hoa Binh have caused the water level of Bui River to rise.

So Thanh and her husband put on conical hats to lure them to higher ground, taking a piece of corrugated iron to cover them temporarily.Her son carried out the aluminum boat in the warehouse and tied it in front of the house just in case. Around noon, the floodwaters had already reached a bit over Thanh's heels.""This year the water rose slowly,"" she said. ""Back in 2018, I took a little nap but when I opened my eyes the water already reached as high as the bed. At the time, soldiers had to come in to help me clean up and my whole family moved into the house of my second son.""Nguyen Dinh Hoa, chairman of Chuong My District, said the government has directed commune to coordinate with local military units to prepare means of evacuating people when the water rises to a dangerous level.The flood scene at Nguyen Thi Toi's house is no different from Thanh's house.The 45-year-old woman and her husband carried two wardrobes and an old refrigerator to the upper floor. At noon on Oct. 18, when the floodwater receded in other areas in the village, her kitchen was still inundated.""During the dry season, I can still grow some crops on the field. But I can't do so during the rainy season,"" said Tam, her husband, pointing at the flooded papaya tree in front of his house.According to the latest report on Chuong My District, nearly 300 hectares of winter crops in the district were completely or partially flooded.But according to Tam, the heavy rain in 2018 was much worse. That year, when he had just finished harvesting rice, the village received heavy downpours, with floodwater reaching up to his back. The couple carried each bag of soaked rice on their boat, pushing it to a few houses near the entrance of the village to dry temporarily.Standing in the middle of the flooded road leading to her house, Hoang Thi Sim, 63, was trying to remove dirt and cement with a bucket normally used to store rainwater.Her house is under construction, and its water system has not yet been installed. ""Every day, I go to my neighbors to ask them for some clean water for daily usage. But I can't visit them since it is hard to bring the clean water back along the flooded road,"" she said.Saving clean water is the first solution for people in Bui Xa to adapt to flooding.Sim said she had purchased a bottle of itching medicine.""I put it on every night, but my feet are still sore,"" she said, showing her white foot, affected from being submerged in water for a long time.Living in a flood-prone area, Bui Xa villagers have actively found solutions to adapt to living conditions. For example, residents always build houses 0.5 to 1 meter higher than the road surface. Most households have a boat ready to use when needed.Every time the water rises, the commune loudspeakers of Bui Xa start to remind people to pack their belongings in case of severe floods, and to evacuate children and the elderly from heavily flooded areas.In September 2020, officials of Chuong My District said to ensure that people do not have to suffer from flooding, the best option is to migrate residents out of the flood-prone area.Chuong My District has proposed that Hanoi prioritizes strengthening and upgrading the Bui River dike system.During this flood, Thanh's two grandchildren and dozens of young kids in the area were pushed by their parents on a boat to a relative's house to stay temporarily. Her neighbors had to evacuate the whole family to another place, to wait until the flood recedes.People wade through a flooded area in Bui Xa Village. Photo by VnExpress/Ha Huy DatTo avoid the situation of rice being soaked in rainwater, Toi and her husband finished harvesting and transported their crop directly to their grandmother's house, located more than a kilometer away. They only plant rice once a year and harvest it by June just before the annual flooding season begins, which usually comes in late July or early August and remains until November or even after.Most locals have simply accepted living with floods.Toi only wishes to be healthy, and have money to build a house higher than the usual floodwater level. Meanwhile, Thanh said that many acquaintances who saw her wading through water twice a day to the market advised her to sell her house and move to another place.She said she doesn't plan to relocate. ""I have to adapt to where I live.""","Vietnam,flooding,heavy rains,Bui Xa Village,Hanoi"
life,trend,Covid forces HCMC conductors to sleep in buses,"Many bus attendants working for Vietnam National University-Ho Chi Minh City (VNUHCM) in Thu Duc City lost their jobs at the end of June when the city stopped bus services to curb the spread of Covid.
Mai Thai Cuong, a 52-year-old from Hanoi, has been living inside a bus since he doesn't have enough money to rent accommodation or return to his hometown. Life in the rural area is difficult, so he moved to the southern metropolis to work as a bus conductor two years ago.
""I thought the Covid resurgence in late April would be stamped out after one month and didn't expect bus services to shut down this long. In the past few months, my colleagues and I have been trying to hold out in these buses,"" he said.Since Cuong lives alone, he only has a few clothes, a mini gas stove, a sleeping mat and a few jugs of water.
He collects rainwater for daily use or purchases some to drink. When there isn’t enough water, he would bathe once every two days.
""Instant noodles and eggs are the dishes I eat the most to help me stay afloat during the month-long lockdown. Now I've gotten tired of eating those. Thankfully, I now have more options to choose from as the city allows takeaway services,"" he said.In the past four days, Cuong and three other bus conductors got jobs as construction workers at a site four kilometers from the bus station.
While waiting for the bus service to resume operation, Cuong said he would take on any seasonal job to earn a living.At 5:30 p.m., after returning home from work, Cuong cleans his ""house"", bus number 53, which usually runs from VNUHCM to Hong Phong Street in District 10.
""I've been hiding from my family that my life here is still fine. My family in the countryside is also poor. Now I am unemployed, I am very sad that I can't send money home to my children,"" he lamented.Similar to Cuong, after work, Thach Cham Pha took advantage of his free time to plant some vegetables to incorporate into his meals.
The 37-year-old of Khmer origin moved from southern Tra Vinh Province to Ho Chi Minh City to earn a living more than 15 years ago. For the first two years, he has done many construction jobs to survive.
""I have a heart condition and can't do heavy work, so I switched to working on a bus. My monthly salary is around VND6 million ($264.34), which is not enough to rent accommodation. So I've been on the bus since before the Covid outbreak broke out,"" he said.Pha's dinner mainly comprises fried leftovers from noon. On the bus, he has installed a rice cooker, fans and blankets.
During the social distancing period, a few other conductors pooled money to buy food, making use of the corner of Pha's kitchen to cook together. They asked a neighbor living near the bus station to let them store food and produce in their refrigerator.After finishing dinner, he takes a shower and washes his clothes at 6:30 p.m.
He pays a household next to the bus station VND50,000 a month to use their water, which he puts in buckets and carries back to use for bathing and washing, and VND100,000 per month to share their electricity bill.
To cook and drink, he has to collect rainwater or buy bottled water.""Every day, I only dare to spend about VND50,000. I also have to save money to buy medicine. In the past few months, I have been supported with some food by donors.
""If bus services won't resume operation soon, I don't think I could hold out much longer with such little savings left,"" he said.Opposite to Pha's bus is the ""home"" of Tran Phu Quy and his son.
Two weeks ago, he picked up his youngest four-year-old from Long Thanh District, Dong Nai Province, to feel less lonely.
Quy has two children, the oldest is 12 and lives in the countryside with his grandparents in Dong Thap Province. His wife works at a factory in Dong Nai and raises the youngest child. Due to the nature of their work, Quy and his wife have to stay far from each other.
In the evening, he often hangs out in a hammock with his son to watch something on the phone together or call his wife.
The cooking is done in Pha's kitchen.
""My son likes to live in the bus station because he can run around everywhere. So he doesn't want to go home. During the five years of doing this job, I have never thought I would be living and sleeping in a bus one day. But I'm used to it now,"" the 41-year-old confirmed.Since the inside of the bus is stuffy, conductors often go to the park nearby to relax or go for a walk.
When night falls, they often sit and drink tea and chat around a homemade wheeled table.""Life here is very boring. If it rains, I will go to sleep early at 9 p.m.,"" Pha said.
""This bus is old and can't close all its doors all the way, so mosquitoes come in a lot, meaning I have to sleep under a net.""Quy sleeps on the floor and lets his son sleep on the hammock. Since his bus is new, the doors can fully close so there is no need for a net.
He hopes bus services would be allowed to operate again soon and be as crowded as before in order for him to have money to pay a debt of VND20 million.
Nguyen Vinh Tung, manager of the bus station of VNUHCM, said there are about 80 buses parked here and nearly 50 drivers and conductors staying here due to the epidemic. Most of the stranded people rent a motel room near the bus station, while more than 10 people are allowed to stay on the bus due to poor circumstances.
""Recently, the bus station also gave each driver and conductor VND1 million. Some also received additional state relief packages and food support,"" Tung said.
From Oct. 4, Ho Chi Minh City reopened four bus routes operating in Can Gio District. On Oct. 25, another four routes would be allowed to resume service, with frequency and operating time depending on the situation and actual needs of each area.","Vietnam,bus station,bus line,bus attendants,HCMC"
life,trend,Hanoi sees mad rush down wedding aisle as Covid restrictions ease,"At midnight Phan Huyen received a phone call from a woman who wanted to organize a wedding two days later.Having worked as a wedding planner for nearly 10 years with a company on Hoang Cau Street, Huyen is no stranger to urgent phone calls from clients.But she has never received more than 20 calls in a day until now.She had to refuse the woman because her schedule was full, and the customer had not prepared anything.She said: ""She had to postpone the wedding to December. Not only our company, but all others are overloaded"".On July 18, the Hanoi People's Committee urged people not to hold weddings as Covid resurfaced. On July 24 the city imposed Directive 16, stopping all non-essential services. Two months later, on Sept. 21, the lockdown was eased and many activities and services were allowed again.Many couples choose to get married in October, 2021. Photo courtesy of Thuyen Giay Wedding & Event PlannerIn October, as more and more couples rush to get married, people in the wedding industry say they are witnessing a ""storm"".Weddings and engagement ceremonies have been mostly scheduled on Oct. 15 and 24, the two most auspicious days of the year in the lunar calendar. On October 15 Huyen was in charge of five weddings and had to work from 5 a.m. to midnight.Duong Bich Hang, owner of a wedding planning company on Hanoi’s Hao Nam Street, had more than 20 marriages in October.On Oct. 24, she will have nearly 30. ""It feels like the whole of Hanoi is getting married on Oct. 15 and 24,"" she said happily.It is not really as if the number of people getting married is more than in previous years; it is just that the pandemic has narrowed the number of auspicious days.Many couples had to postpone their weddings due to the lockdowns, and are scrambling to get married as soon as possible lest another outbreak begins. Some have been waiting to gauge the pandemic situation and so only decide to organize weddings at very short notice.""The problem is that wedding services are not like selling clothes,"" Hang said, explaining, ""It consists of countless stages, and each company is different"".A wedding takes four days to prepare for on average, and could take 10 if the bride and groom are choosy.Most weddings put pressure on all involved, including brides, grooms, their families, and organizers.Tran Lan Huong, 29, of Cau Giay District was planning to marry on Oct. 15 before deciding to cancel it when Hanoi was in lockdown in July.In early October, seeing that the pandemic situation was better, she contacted her wedding planner again and chose to get married on Oct. 15.""Fortunately, they still prioritized me,"" she said.The wedding went smoothly, but Huong was upset because she could not stitch an and had to wear an old dress instead.The huge demand for professionals meant she had to do her own makeup and her brother had to take photos.""I will definitely regret (not having nice photos) in future,"" she said.An employee of a wedding planning company decorates a backdrop for a wedding in Hanoi, October, 2021. Photo courtesy of Song Anh Wedding & EventsMany are also in a hurry to marry due to pressure from their family.On Oct.18, Nguyen Huyen My’s parents told her to get married on an auspicious day this month though she was not ready.""I cried for two days because I could not lose weight in such a short period of time,"" the woman living in Dong Da District said. Her goal had been to lose 10 kg to wear a pretty wedding dress.Huyen said: ""Brides and grooms, especially brides, normally think since they will only get married once everything should be perfect. But parents prioritize auspicious days, causing conflicts"".For the last two weeks Hang and her staff have worked from 3 a.m. to evening every day, sometimes staying up all night to iron clothes, wash dishes, prepareflowers, and design backdrops, arrange tables and chairs.Hang also has to seek forgiveness from clients if her staff go to their houses for decoration earlier or later than scheduled.Though these businesses and other service providers’ revenues were hit by the pandemic, they try to keep the same prices and ensure quality, often by limiting the number of customers they take on.Brides and grooms’ families and service providers are forced to adapt to pandemic needs.For instance, many organize an engagement ceremony and welcome the bride to the husband’s home just once, instead of having two different ceremonies.Parties are also smaller and more intimate.For a wedding ceremony on Oct. 19, Le Huong Giang, 28, of Ba Dinh District reduced the number of guests by 90 percent from her original plan. She spent money improving the food and drinks, flowers and makeup. The party had performances by the bride and groom and their friends.Huyen said: ""No ‘diplomatic’ guests, everyone was comfortable and the wedding was more meaningful. This will probably be the trend of future weddings"".To reduce the pressure, consultants advise couples to decide on the wedding as soon as possible to get more time to prepare. They are also recommended to specify the budget and standards to quickly select suppliers, and hire professional wedding organizers if they do not have time for preparations.Many people are also opting not to get caught in the ""storm"".After five years of a long-distance relationship while she was studying abroad, Nguyen Van Anh, 30, thought that she would get married soon after returning to Vietnam, but has instead decided to postpone the plan indefinitely.Her house and her boyfriend’s are in Covid hotspots Van Mieu and Van Chuong wards.Anh is not sure when she will get married, but for her, the top priority is everyone's safety and comfort.""An auspicious day is a day without the pandemic,"" she said.""Moreover, our love is what determines everything.""","couple,wedding,family,young people,Covid-19,pandemic,Hanoi"
life,trend,Young Vietnamese see meditation as stress buster,"Ngoc has never practiced meditation before, and joined the class at the suggestion of a friend. Staying at home and having conflicts with family members in the last few months of the Covid-19 lockdown, she yearned for something that could help her find peace of mind.""This class was free, so I gave it a try,"" the 30-year-old, a resident of Cau Giay District in Hanoi, said.At the same time, on the third floor of a house in Dong Da District, Nguyen Thuy Dung, Ngoc’s friend, was also waiting for the meditation session to begin.It would be the third meditation class for Dung in the last year. The IT worker wants to get over a past relationship.By 8:30 p.m. the class had nearly 200 attendees. All of them turned off their cameras and microphones, listening to the meditator’s guidance.The class was organized by Minh Dao, 28, a writer who has been practicing meditation for six years. He has started the class ""as a gift for everyone amid Covid-19.""The Cambridge dictionary defines meditation as ""the act of giving your attention to only one thing, either as a religious activity or as a way of becoming calm and relaxed.""Nguyen Cao Minh, a lecturer at the Vietnam National University in Hanoi’s University of Education who is highly trained in using mindfulness and meditation to address psychological problems, said meditation could simply be understood as focusing on the present moment and accepting everything that is happening, including thoughts and feelings without judgment.In Vietnam, meditation has long been popular since it has spiritual and cultural underpinnings.But it is becoming increasingly popular among young people.Minh said: ""In the past people were often interested in meditation when they were 40-45 years old. Now this age range is much lower, mainly 30 and below.""Dao estimated that 80 percent of people in his meditation class are 18-35 years old. Huynh Nguyen, owner of a meditation studio on Hanoi’s Nguyen Du Street for the last three years, has also noticed a reduction in practitioners’ ages.Huynh Nguyen during a meditation session in 2020. Photo courtesy of Huynh""The largest number of them are from 22 to 40 years old.""Young Vietnamese often know about meditation classes via the Internet.Once while surfing social networks, Dung typed the word ""meditation,"" and got information about Dao and Nguyen’s classes. Some people like Ngoc learned from friends.Why are young people attracted to meditation more than before? Minh listed two main reasons: to develop themselves and to deal with stress.Both these needs are high among young people, especially the latter, he said.Compared to previous generations, young people now are more interested in mental health, and actively seek ways to prevent and mitigate mental issues, he said.Nguyen said his students often face problems such as stress, fatigue and insomnia.Dao said most of his students experience ""negative thoughts and emotions.""""The inner lives of young people are being ravaged by social networks not to mention the fact that the recent lockdown gave them time to look at themselves and realize that their problems are not always caused by the outside world, but also by their inner self.""Meditation has been accessible and affordable in Vietnam in the last few years. A five-week basic meditation course offered by Nguyen costs less than VND2 million ($86.2). During the pandemic, he has organized classes online, allowing participants to pay based on what they want.Dao does not charge any fees.Huynh Nguyen (sitting, 2nd left) and his students at a meditation class before the recent lockdown in Hanoi. Photo courtesy of HuynhMeditation classes must be carefully and logically designed so that learners can feel comfortable.""Depressed people already have negative thoughts; we don't want them to feel worse,"" Minh said.Experts said meditation is not a panacea for all psychological problems, warning that for people with paranoid or psychotic disorders, it could even be dangerous.Minh said: ""When we practice meditation, we turn inward, develop faith in our experience. If ones do it incorrectly, they should not do it.""But, in general, meditation helps relieve stress and understand oneself better, and so is useful for almost everyone.Dao and Nguyen said meditation gives young people more tools to live peacefully and ""touch their emotions"".After Dao's mediation sessions, some participants have shared they burst into tears when they remembered bad events and connected with their past.Ngoc is not familiar with meditation, and said she would attend one more session to see how it goes.Dung feels at peace. She will continue to attend meditation classes, because she sees it as an opportunity to sort through chaotic thoughts and heal the spirit.""Meditation is very difficult. Reading books and listening to lectures from others are only the start,"" Minh concluded.Ultimately, individuals must listen to themselves, develop faith in their own experiences and understand the nature of meditation.""","Vietnam,Vietnamese youth,mediation,mental health,Covid-19"
life,culture,Filmmakers 'work in the field of culture but go against culture',"A film crew making 'Chuyen Lang Bom' (Bom Village’s Story) recently painted white an ancient well in Hanoi’s Mong Phu Village. Earlier, those making 'Thai Su Tran Thu Tho' (Great Tutor Tran Thu Do) shocked many by moving the altar of Emperor Minh Mang while filming. Painter Truong Duc Thang, a member of the ""Chuyen Lang Bom"" crew, was fined VND2 million ($88.39) on Nov. 10 for writing, drawing and desecrating a historical-cultural monument.Nguyen Van Huy, former director of the Hanoi-based Museum of Ethnology, said that such actions were an infringement on historical relics and monuments.""They work in the field of culture but go against culture. The act of renewing the ancient relic, making it mossy to film a movie is ridiculous.""""The Duong Lam ancient village has been ranked a national historical monument for a long time. It is unacceptable to film there without respecting it. Those making art but have no understanding of it should be severely punished,"" a reader commented.The ancient well in Mong Phu Village is painted and decorated by the crew of 'Chuyen Lang Bom.' Photo by Do Doan HoangIn 2010, when filming 'Thai Su Tran Thu Do' at Emperor Minh Mang’s Tomb located in the complex of Hue monuments, the film crew moved all the altars of the king and his family to the corner of the hall, making room for the king and queen's bedroom in a movie scene. The main hall was also full of electric wires, lamp posts, tables and chairs, clothes, personal belongings... of the film crew. The team had to clean up and rearrange the main hall to its original state later. The Co Loa Citadel in Hanoi was also painted by a film crew.Such actions by crews looking to create film sets to match their stories have angered many.Tran Dinh Thanh, Deputy Director of the Cultural Heritage Department under the Ministry of Culture, Sports and Tourism, said while such actions were rare, recent incidents were a reminder for filmmakers to be more careful.Putting a positive spin on it, he said the public concern shows that awareness of cultural heritage protection has significantly improved.Thanh said movies and TV shows set in historical sites help promote their cultural values to the public. Therefore, authorities need to encourage and facilitate this. But in order to limit mistakes, film crews must contact the management board and local authorities to ask for permission and present the content of the works before they do it. They must also comply with the regulations, carefully study the monuments to know the do's and don'ts and comply accordingly.Management boards must also guide and supervise the crew throughout the filmmaking process, he added.""The two sides must coordinate to minimize unnecessary incidents, anticipate negative impacts on our heritage, and take measures to prevent and adjust films’ content based on the principles of heritage preservation.""'Gai Gia Lam Chieu 5' is filmed in An Dinh Palace in the ancient capital of Hue. Photo courtesy of 'Gai Gia Lam Chieu 5'Many film crews have said that they were careful when filming amidst cultural and historical monuments.The movie 'Gai Gia Lam Chieu 5' (Camellia Sisters) is set in the ancient capital of Hue. Director Namcito proposed using the An Dinh Palace as the main set for the film to the People's Committee of Thua Thien Hue Province and other concerned departments a year before shooting.The team had to present plans to maintain the palace’s status quo. After obtaining approval, they had to sign a commitment not to touch the wall, scratch the floor, damage the glass door and so on.Namcito said: ""Besides upholstering the edges of chairs and tables, hanging pictures without sticking them to the wall, hanging curtains without nails, we made warning signs and instructed staff to avoid contact with antiques.""In order to move the artifacts or change any detail, they had to make a written request to the management board. Scenes were filmed during the hot summer season in Hue and the crew had to install air conditioners that did not touch the palace’s walls.Actor Vuong Rau said that because he regularly performs comedy shows in ancient villages and historical sites, he had to ask for permission from the authorities first.During the filming process, he and his crew were careful not to change anything from the original. They also reminded each other to be careful with words and actions. ""Creating good or bad artworks is another story, but destroying heritage is terrible,"" he said.Many countries have enacted regulations to ensure that filming does not affect historical sites.According to Chinese news site Sina, some localities in China have had their relics and antiques damaged during filming. Therefore, since 2000, many have issued their own regulations to protect their heritage.For scenes that are shot for films such as the Forbidden City, companies in China build monumental film sets, recreating palaces and other structures to serve filmmakers and tourists.The Heng Dian World Studio in Zhejiang Province - a complex that serves many functions including filming, tourism, and relaxation, is one such film set. From 1996 until now, the Heng Dian Group has invested more than $425 million to build Hong Kong Street, palaces of the Qing and Ming Dynasties, Palaces of Qin Dynasty, etc. for filming and tourism. Thousands of movies and TV series have been filmed here, including many famous works.In Beijing, an $850 million studio in Huairou has similarly attracted many filmmakers.In the U.K., filmmakers hire supervisors to advise and monitor filming activities to avoid damaging any historical or cultural vestige. According to the British Institute of Conservation, all concerned parties need to sign a contract and discuss the footage thoroughly. The person in charge of the scene has to submit a proposal that includes the aims of the crew, risk assessments and safe filming methods.The conservation unit needs to know if the recording content is suitable for the relic site or not, to avoid filming ""hot"" and violent scenes in inappropriate places. The contract must be agreed and signed by both parties before shooting.The James Bond film crew is famous for choosing historical settings for filming without causing damage to buildings and monuments. In ""No Time To Die"", the team went to the ancient city of Matera in Italy to shoot many action scenes. Chris Corbould - responsible for the technical effects of the project - said the team organized 14 trips before the place was chosen. To protect the ancient structures of the city, they wrapped buildings with special materials and decorated them like real walls. The film crew then freely shot the action scenes without fear of damaging the old structures.Huy, former director of the ethnology museum in Hanoi, said that if and when a mistake happens when shooting, the film crew should ask experts to study and fix it instead of doing it on their own.""It is necessary to raise awareness and cultural behavior towards monuments and tourism spots. It takes us hundreds of years to build and preserve ancient relics, but they can be easily demolished in a moment.""","movie,film,cinema,culture,moviemaker"

Since she has to process lots of documents, she finds working from home a bit challenging and less efficient.So for the past few weeks she has been taking her daughter to work, and gets her toys and coloring books so that she does not disturb others in office.""It is a bit of a concern trying to keep everything running smoothly without neglecting my kid and my work responsibilities,"" she said.She feels safe taking her daughter to the office since the majority of her colleagues are fully vaccinated.Some people have decided to stop working temporarily and stay at home with their children to keep them safe from the coronavirus.Nguyen Thi Hue, a worker at a textile firm in Binh Tan District, asked for a month’s leave when told to return to work on Oct. 1.""I normally send them to a relative living nearby, but she in now busy with her two children, so I must stay at home,"" Hue, whose husband is a motorbike-taxi driver, said.She hoped that when travel restrictions are lifted, her mother in Da Nang would come and help take care of her five-year-old son.Bao, Huong and Hue all know that going to work on certain days, taking kids to work or quitting work cannot be a long-term solution.But with schools not reopening until early next year and vaccination in limbo, they have little choice.""I hope children can be vaccinated as soon as possible, so that they can venture out again after months of staying at home and looking at computer screens,"" Evans said while taking his son for a ride around their neighborhood one evening.""He always wants to go to the mall and do some shopping, but I cannot allow that at the moment.""","children,student,Covid-19,pandemic,HCMC,Saigon,education"

life,vietnamese-prefer-to-quit-rather-than-return-to-office-4376643.html,Vietnamese prefer to quit rather than return to office,"For nearly three weeks now Thien Nhi has not had to struggle with getting up early and commuting to work.She wakes up at 8 a.m. and finishes her breakfast first before working in the comfort of her own home.The 26-year-old in Hanoi saves on gas but is also more focused since she does not have to socialize and interact with co-workers. Her month's work quota was finished ahead of schedule, allowing her to take on more outside work, and her income during the pandemic was up by half.Two months of working from home helped her realize this was the ideal way to live and work.She says: ""I can work sitting on my bed, and walk freely around my room. I can eat and drink without being reminded or judged by anyone.""Nhi is hardly alone when it comes to love to work from home.Lan works at home in Hanoi's Cau Giay District on Sep. 21. Photo by VnExpress/Quynh NguyenMai Lan, 28, of Hanoi’s Cau Giay District, also does not want to return to office. She worked as a content marketer for a company in Dong Da District, but was told to work from home since late July as Covid.When Hanoi eased restrictions starting Sept. 21, Lan and Nhi along with millions of other workers in the capital began to return to the office.Nhi was late to work on the first day and sat in front of the computer the whole day but barely did anything. It was her least productive day in the last two months.""Working in the office is tiring,"" she says with a sigh.Lan found herself in a similar situation and says returning to the office full time overwhelmed her. Her workload had doubled from the work-from-home period, and she had to attend multiple meetings from morning to late evening and even had to cut short her afternoon nap.She felt depressed having to spend time communicating with colleagues and observing their behavior.""I didn't enjoy going back to the office,"" she says.After two weeks both Nhi and Lan resigned.""Many people say I'm crazy to quit my job,"" Nhi says.She explains that working from home is more efficient and offers her the opportunity to increase her income.Some of her friends have also switchedjobs, she says.Tran Anh Tuan, a human resources forecaster and chairman of the Scientific Council at the Institute of Training and Human Resource Development, says: ""Switching jobs after the pandemic is an inevitable trend as many people have adapted or found value in working remotely"".This is also happening in many other countries.A recent survey by the Office for National Statistics, the U.K.'s largest independent producer of official statistics, found that more than 56 percent of unemployed people are not actively looking for a new job. They also do not want to go back to their pre-pandemic jobs, or, if they do, ask to work from home.According to the U.S. Department of Labor, in August alone 4.3 million workers quit their jobs, 242,000 more than in July and the highest number since December 2000.A recent survey of Vietnamese workers who quit their jobs recently after going back to the office found most of them to be individuals who have saved money or found a new direction for their work.Nhi says the decision to quit was not impulsive and she became confident when she saw new money-making opportunities outside her previous job.""Job shift after the pandemic is encouraging to develop the economy and not disrupt the labor market structure,"" Tuan says.According to experts, the most suitable age for remote working is between the ages of 25 and 40.""Those who have just graduated and are inexperienced should not try switching jobs at the moment,"" Tuan warns.Around the world, the lack of caregivers during and after the pandemic has also created a wave of transitions to non-office jobs.In June last year Care.com, an online marketplace that connects caregivers with families in need of their services, published an online survey of 1,000 parents with young children that showed that 15 percent considered quitting their jobs. The rest said they plan to make suitable job changes to take care of their children.This is also a problem that prevents Nguyen Nga, 35, in Hanoi's Hoang Mai District from returning to office.She was told to go to the office after Sept. 21, but says: ""I cannot go to go to work and take care of my children at the same time"".Faced with a widespread problem created by parents going to work and children staying at home and studying online, some businesses in Hanoi are allowing employees to bring their children to the office or work from home every other day.Nga says her parents live far away from her and so cannot come to help with the children. Her husband's company does not let him work on certain days of the week and their children are too young for her to take them to her office. She is afraid to send them to daycare amid the pandemic.""If the company does not allow me to work from home, I'll have to quit and find another job"".Working from home in the recent lockdown, Hoang Tran, a 27-year-old in HCMC's District 3, was eager to return to her office.Tran at her office on Sep. 21, 2021. Photo courtesy of TranAfter nearly five months of working remotely, she misses the feeling of working in office. She says it helps her concentrate better, and connect and exchange easier with colleagues and bosses, something that virtual work does not.""Staying at home for too long makes me crave social interaction"".Eddy Ng, a professor at Queen's University in Ontario, Canada, who did a survey last summer of 424 remote workers, says: ""Young workers need relationships, close friends, people to communicate with and advise in work or life"".His research found that among people aged over 40, 45 percent wanted to continue working remotely after the pandemic compared with 30 percent for people under 40.He says he notices a sign of FOMO (Fear Of Missing Out) in younger participants.This is true for Tran, an extrovert who enjoys sharing and participating in group activities and feels lonely and left out when working from home.In early October Tran's agency began to assign work shifts for employees, but she hopes to go to work all week and life will soon return to normal.The newspaper in August quoted Adam Galinsky, a professor of organizational behavior at Columbia Business School in the U.S., as saying that young workers who are working remotely may be missing out on important skills in the workplace.""The thing that most concerns me is mentoring. A lot of lessons are absorbed casually in an office, but you can’t take any of that for granted in a virtual workplace.""Workers who start a new job remotely may miss the ""burst of socialization and organizational energy"" that happens during traditional, in-person orientations, he said.Tuan says: ""But people shouldn't think working from home is easier and more leisure than in the office.""Remote workers still have to work with high intensity on computers, closely monitor the situation and still face a lot of pressure from customers, he says.""But no matter what, working from home is becoming a trend in the labor market.""","Vietnam,workfoce,remote working,work from home,jobs,parents,Covid-19,social distancing,reopening"

life,culture,Vietnamese citizens slam distortion of history in Chinese TV drama,"According to some Chinese websites and film forums, the TV series, titled ""Ace Troops,"" has the Vietnamese army launching an invasion and its China counterpart acting in self-defense. However, the exact opposite is true. China had invaded Vietnam without any justification and Vietnam had to fight back in self-defense.On Oct. 6, an account named Ali commented on Douban - China's largest film forum - about ""Ace Troops"": ""The drama does not reflect history, it distorts information about Vietnam.""Earlier, on the Weibo social network, some Chinese bloggers had summarized the movie's plot. Yundanfengqing, with nearly 15,000 followers, wrote: ""The series is set in the 1980s, the Vietnamese army grows strong and wanting China's territory, launches an invasion at the Chinese border. Facing this situation, in 1979, China launches a self-defence counterattack.""On the  website, the trailer and poster of ""Ace Troops"" show that the film depicts the war on the northern border of Vietnam. According to , another Chinese website, the film is about ""Chinese soldiers in a self-defence counterattack against Vietnam"".Another website, , summarizes the series as having a timeline spanning 40 years starting in 1983, tracing the stories of two army rookies Gao Liang (Huang Johnny) and Gu Yi Ye (Sean Xiao). Liang is from a mining family, while Ye grows up in a military family. Both are aggressive and hate each other before becoming friends. They go through the war together, clearing landmines in Guangxi. The series, directed by Liu Yan, has released a trailer but has not announced its broadcast schedule.A still from ""Ace Troops"".Many netizens have pointed out that the clothes worn by the actors in the trailer match those of Chinese soldiers when they invaded Vietnam in 1979.The trailer also includes scenes of the Chinese army firing shells and soldiers wearing camouflage and using AK submachine guns. The artillery was the main force used by China in the war it instigated in 1979.On many forums in Vietnam and China, many Vietnamese netizens have strongly opposed the summary of the TV series by Yundanfengqing and others.Nguyen Thanh Ngan 2412 wrote: ""You tell a wrong history, distorted information. This drama needs to be boycotted no matter how much they have invested in it.""Diep Ha Nhien commented: ""Haven't you read history, why is it so badly and wrongly written?""Minh Anh220824 wrote: ""Stop distorting history.

They are deliberately distorting history, that's their intention.""Hai also said that young people today are well aware of national sovereignty.""They are better than us because they have the opportunity to access information, take advantage of the media to spread opinions, spread truth and facts. I believe in the young generation. When we talk about Fatherland, automatically we will be united,"" the veteran said.At dawn on Feb. 7, 1979, more than 600,000 Chinese troops simultaneously attacked the borders of six northern provinces of Vietnam. Armed forces, militias and ethnic minority communities at the border fought them on the spot, forcing the Chinese to withdraw from Vietnam on March 18 of the year. However, the withdrawal was not complete, and China continued to maintain forces at the border, harassing Vietnamese localities and triggering hostilities that lasted the next decade.Gunfire continued on the Vi Xuyen Front after 1981, when the Chinese army began to attack with artillery shells. In late April 1984, Chinese troops illegally occupied many places along the Ha Giang border. The Vietnamese army organized a counterattack to regain these spots.In 1984 and 1985, the two sides fought fierce battles. It was only by 1988 that the border situation eased, with the two countries actively withdrawing their troops.According to the Liaison Committee of the Veterans of the Battle of Vi Xuyen, between 1984 and 1989, more than 4,000 Vietnamese soldiers died, thousands of people were injured, and the remains of more than 2,000 martyrs have not yet been found.","China,Vietnam,history,movie,border war"

The outbreak has had a significant impact on 89s Group, Hoa's film and television production firm, especially during the four-month lockdown period in Ho Chi Minh City ending Oct. 1.According to the director, the company has only produced nine short episodes since the beginning of the year, compared to 40 films last year. During the same time period, revenue fell from almost VND36 billion to around VND3 billion.The film ‘Chia Khoa Tram Ti’ (Rough translation: The Hundred Billion Key) he directed and co-produced with Orange Films, was supposed to be released on April 30, but it had to be postponed.Several film studios are in the same boat. BHD has postponed the screenings of four films: Ly Nha Ky's ‘Bi Mat Thien Duong’ (Secret of Paradise), Luu Huynh's ‘Nguoi Tinh’ and ‘Tim Han Vet Seo’ (The Scarred Heart), and Ham Tran’s Maika and ‘Co Be Den Tu Hanh Tinh Khac’ (The Little Girl From Another Plannet).Three more significant film projects have been pushed back. Ngo Thi Bich Hien, CEO of BHD in HCMC, said: ""When the fourth epidemic struck, we were just getting back on our feet. All operations were halted as a result of the shutdown. Because the data is too large for technical staff to handle at home, even post-production operations are done in moderation.""Jung Tae Sun, general director of CJ HK Entertainment, stated the number of CJ films in cinemas declined by 30 percent from January to September compared to the same period last year, and by 60 percent compared to 2019.In the last four months, revenue has been essentially non-existent. Because they had been delayed for too long, some projects had to cancel their screenings.Galaxy Play has over 15 exclusive movie projects in the works, but all were put on hold for four months.From the end of May, the Mar6 studio halted all unresolved filming projects, including ‘Tu Dai My Nhan’ (Four Great Beauties.

I don't think I'll be able to shoot again till next year,"" he said. ""As a result, the release date isn't fixed and a number of our other projects have been postponed.""The ""freeze"" of production, according to producers, has drained the company's contingency funds. Twenty film producers noted in an official  and HCMC People's Committee on Sept. 21 that restoring operations in a short time would be challenging, and many people are at risk of losing their jobs.In a May dispatch to the Prime Minister, four film distributors, Thien Ngan, BHD, Lotte Cinema, and CJ CGV, stated their screening and distribution revenue has been nearly zero since February, despite continuing to shoulder the costs of facilities, employee salaries, and benefits. According to Thien Ngan's spokesman, the company loses tens of billions of dong per month.""In this circumstance, both major and small enterprises could go bankrupt, resulting in the film industry's eventual downfall.""Movie producers are trying many short-term solutions to cope To support its 200 employees, BHD has had to reduce part of their salaries with their consent.

They hope that from Oct. 15 the Government would allow studios to work if they have proper Covid-19 control measures such as: online pre-production, downsizing of staff when filming, PCR testing before filming, quick testing every seven days, or making sure all crew members have been vaccinated and tested negative.The studios also plan to do production in less populated areas like film studios, inactive eco-tourism areas, and empty residential lots.A representative of Galaxy Play said that since their employees have been fully vaccinated and are qualified to work, they are preparing for production in early October if allowed. They will immediately embark on 15 postponed projects. In addition, during the pandemic, they took the time to research 15 new projects for 2022, out of which three will enter pre-production.Director Namcito of Mar6 said:""If we are allowed to produce, we still have to consider the epidemic situation. When it is really safe and stable, we will decide to shoot. This is a big project that requires filming not only in Saigon but also in other provinces. I don't dare to shoot now. If I have to delay it, the damage will be huge.""HCMC resumed most activities last Friday after over four months of imposing different levels of social distancing.

Before the pandemic, he spent a lot of time traveling to ancient villages like Duong Lam and Cu Da in Hanoi seeking inspiration.It usually takes him about two weeks to come up with an idea before starting on the final painting.The biggest challenge entails the rapid disappearance of Vietnamese village landscapes. When going on a field trip, he would often interview local residents to gain a contextual understanding of his surroundings.Many of his works are inspired by the house where his family used to live in Xuan Hong Commune, Xuan Truong District, Nam Dinh Province.""Khoang San Truoc Nha"" (The Yard) by Tran Nguyen.When he was young, his parents worked far from home, so Nguyen lived with his grandparents. His favorite painting is ""Khoang San Truoc Nha"" (The Yard), depicting a grandfather sitting on a bamboo cot with his grandson. The yard is filled with jars, dry vegetables, and tubers.In ""Ky Uc Ve Ba"" (Memory of Grandma), he painted his grandmother wearing traditional clothes, sitting and drying cassava in a sunny courtyard.Nguyen spent a lot of time taking care of details like the water tank, the bricks, pile of straw, and shading.""Som Mai Cua Me"" (Mother’s Morning) depicts a mother washing clothes by a mossy well, while the father prepares to take their children to school.""Som Mai Cua Me"" (Mother’s Morning) by Tran Nguyen.In order to set himself apart from other painters of rural lives, Nguyen includes the childhood memories of many generations in his works. Street vendors to tea stalls, wells, paved village roads, flower trellises, all appear in Nguyen’s paintings. He said he always chooses new perspectives so he could avoid repetition.During the Covid-19 lockdown, Nguyen stayed in his house in Hanoi, focusing on composing new artwork.Through online forums, Nguyen has connected with many collectors and art lovers, selling more than 40 paintings, each going for around VND20 million ($880).Nguyen was born in 1990 into an agricultural family. He has been interested in drawing since childhood, studying fine art design at the University of Theater and Performing Arts in Hanoi.After graduation, he worked as a graphic designer at a Japanese game company before becoming a freelance artist. He plans to host his own exhibition in the near future.","art,fine art,Vietnamese art,painting,painter"

Trang is fluent in English and Korean, knows how to drive a car, cooks well, and meets many strict requirements of the family. A scene in which Trang and Kang Mi Na (played by Lee) - Hanju's daughter-in-law - talk in Vietnamese, thrilled many series lovers.Kang Mi Na (played by Lee) speaks Vietnamese with Trang (played by Huong) in ""One the Woman."" Video cut from the TV seriesBut this is not the first time Huong has worked with Lee. In 2007, she first met the South Korean actress during a cultural exchange program in Hanoi.Lee was the cultural ambassador, and she was an event coordinator. Fourteen years later, the two met again on the set of ""One the Woman"".""Such a destiny,"" Lee told Huong when hearing about their meeting in 2007. Facing difficulties in Vietnamese intonation, Lee practiced many times under Huong’s guidance.The first scene they talk in Vietnamese was later completed after just one shot.Lee cared a lot for her colleagues, Huong recalled. Seeing Huong on set, the actress always waved her hands and said hello, calling Huong ""teacher Trang.""Playing a supporting role, Huong was prioritized to film first so she could leave earlier. Lee also reminded the team to pay attention to lighting effects, so her ""teacher"" could look more beautiful on screen.""She is a famous star but she is plain, friendly, and cares for others. Although I only gave her a few pronunciation lessons, she called me teacher. Meeting her can improve your mood,"" Huong said.But years ago, when she decided to leave Vietnam for South Korea, she never thought about becoming an actress.Nguyen Thi Huong plays a maid in ""One the Woman."" Photo courtesy of Nguyen Thi HuongA fan of five-member boyband H.O.T during high school, Huong started learning Korean to have a better understanding of the country of her idols. After university graduation, she pursued her master’s degree at Sookmyung Women's University in Seoul.She joined the Vietnamese traditional dance group, often performing at cultural exchange programs between the two countries. Thanks to that, she improved her confidence and started looking for auditions for TV series.She first appeared in a TV series as a foreign woman in KBS's ""Hometown Over the Hill"" season two. To secure the role, she had to pass three casting rounds, competing with more than 100 people from Thailand, China, and Laos, many of whom had learned acting at school.Everything was new to her, from reading scripts, acting in front of cameras, and working with a team of many people. Mistakes were inevitable. But later, she started to adapt to her new environment.""Hometown Over the Hill"" features 125 episodes and was screened from 2012 to 2015. To play the role, Huong took a train to film sets every night, after finishing her studies and part-time job, and returned to Seoul early the next morning to start class.Once, her scene was shot on the day she had an exam, so Huong asked to film another day. While her colleagues agreed, an angry crew member said she had disrupted the plan.""There were a lot of fatigue and loneliness in that journey. Low salaries could only help me afford train tickets, daily meals and monthly rental, so I could not pay for acting classes, but I loved the job, so I kept pursuing it.""Her greatest joy was seeing her own improvement after each episode. One of the most unforgettable colleagues she has worked with is actress Woo Hee Jin, appearing with Huong in ""Feelings"". Jin bought her food, drove her from film sets to Seoul, and helped her save money. In an interview, Jin also complimented Huong, saying she was kind, friendly, and spoke Korean fluently.Later, Huong played roles in many series like ""Challenge! Golden Bell,"" ""Yoyumanman,"" along with documentaries and short movies of broadcasters including EBS, SBS, KBS.In 2019, she played a Vietnamese wife whose husband suffered from cancer in ""Chocolate"", in which the scene in which the couple talked about their memories before he died made many audiences cry.In late 2020, director Choi Young Hoon wanted to find a Vietnamese woman with acting experience to play Trang in ""One the Woman."" Huong was the best candidate.Trang is a supporting character, so Huong’s schedule on set was not fixed. Most of her scenes were filmed within the Hanju family’s villa, which was in fact divided between different locations, so Huong had to move back and forth.Nguyen Thi Huong (R) and Ha Ji Won. Photo courtesy of Nguyen Thi HuongFilming amid the pandemic was also a challenge. She was required to take a Covid test before entering each set, and when someone in the crew was infected, the whole crew had to take some days off.""It was more stressful, we worked and worried at the same time because there were too many people on set.""In return, she earned $2,000 per episode, which helped her stay afloat amid the pandemic. If the series is re-screened on other channels, she will earn more.""One the Woman"" is currently attracting a lot of audiences, so many of her friends, colleagues, and famous stars, have texted to congratulate her.Apart from acting, Huong has also worked as an interpreter and Vietnamese language teacher. But due to the pandemic, cultural exchange programs between Vietnam and South Korea have been quiet, so her income has been negatively affected.Huong mostly works with embassies, courts, procurators, and the Vietnamese community in South Korea. She is one of seven Vietnamese who have a certificate in interpreting for courts in the country. Getting married to a South Korean man in 2012, Huong now has two children and South Korean citizenship.""When I met H.O.T, they said they did not expect their music would change people’s life.

Photo courtesy of VFCTrung Anh, who played Luong Bong, the criminal in the series, said ‘Nguoi Phan Xu’ was not as violent or sexual as the Israeli original, ‘Ha-Borer’.""In my opinion, the series reflects reality, and viewers can realize there is bad and evil, thereby avoid making mistakes.""The Vietnamese version underwent a lot of changes to suit the country’s culture, he said.In the serial, Bong, despite being loved by viewers, dies in the end.Anh said the character is shown as having a complicated life to convey the message that not everyone is born a criminal.""He lived in the crime world, and was aware of its evil but could not shake it off. Before he dies, he gives a notebook containing a lot of important information to the police. According to the script, Luong Bong would not die, but I told the director the character should commit suicide.""Other artists said Vietnamese crime films often depict tough battles between the forces of good and evil, promoting the concept of justice, pointing out that in the end the police always triumph over the underworld.The drama ‘Me Cung’ (Maze) directed by Khai Anh and screened in 2019 depicts a battle between the police and a serial killer nicknamed Fedora. But despite her street smarts, Fedora is eventually captured and faces justice.Nguyen Hai, who has played many criminal roles in movies, said criminals are portrayed as daring and dangerous to show the hardships faced by the police.""If criminals in movies are not portrayed realistically, the fight for justice in movies will lose its meaning.""Many of the movie industry insiders saidpeople’s awareness has increased, and audiences now watch movies for entertainment and enjoyment and do not take them to heart.Compared to elsewhere, movies in this genre account for only a small proportion in Vietnam.Director Charlie Nguyen said Korea has Park Chan Wook's ‘Oldboy’ and the U.S. had many famous directors like Alfred Hitchcock who made a series of movies on serial killers, attracting audiences of all ages.""No one watches a movie to be taught how to do this or that. The first function of movies is entertainment. Fans watch crime movies because they want to learn about the crime world.""Some filmmakers said Vietnamese movie censors and authorities should take a fairer view of their works, so the cinema industry can develop better.Many streaming services like Netflix and HBO broadcast foreign films with violence and crime that attract a large number of viewers because of their entertainment, they pointed out.According to directors Hungand Nguyen, international films on streaming platforms do not face the strict censorship domestic films do.Nguyen said people should have an open look at crime movies because it is a difficult genre, and many moviemakers did not dare try their hand at it.""If General Major Toi's proposal is approved, I am afraid many filmmakers will quit because they feel they are not properly protected or supported by the authorities.""Director Nguyen Hoang Diep agreed: ""Vietnamese films face more difficulties than foreign films because foreign ones are not censored much. If such a proposal is approved, filmmakers will reject good topics just to be safe.""Director Nguyen Quang Dung said this proposal is likely to take the cinema industry backward.Some filmgoers agreed with the moviemakers, saying it is not reasonable to claim movies lead to a rise in crime.Nevertheless, they said, authorities should classify movies and series carefully based on theme, content, language and whether it portrays violence, sex, horror, or drugs.""Especially those shown during primetime on TV, because normally children also watch them,"" Nguyen Thanh Hang of Hanoi’s Long Bien District said.Vietnam has four classifications for movies in cinemas: P for general audiences, C13 for viewers ages 13 and above, C16 for viewers aged 16, and C18 for adults.But there are no ratings for TV serials.The Law on Cinema was passed by the 11th National Assembly on June 29, 2006.

life,culture,Experts on why Vietnamese songs are going viral,"Recently, the hip-shake dance from '' (Over Two Minutes) by Vietnamese rapper Phao, real name Nguyen Dieu Huy, became a phenomena on Tiktok and Chinese version Douyin with hundreds of thousands of users making dance covers of the song and attracting billions of views.The song became such a mega hit worldwide that it even topped the most searched song list globally on Shazam, an app that can identify music and TV shows by listening to a short audio sample, in December last year. It later entered the Top 12 of World Digital Song Sales, including work released outside the U.S. with the highest digital sales of the week, of Billboard last February.In addition to 'Hai Phut Hon', songs like '' (Easy to Come Easy to Go) and 'The Magic Bomb Remix' by Hoang Read and Tai Muzik, which sparked the ""chopping dance"" trend, have also blown up in Chinese, South Korean and American media.Most of the Vietnamese songs loved by international audiences are remixes with bold electronic music (EDM) styles.American online music publication  pointed out in an article published earlier this month that most viral hits stemming from Vietnam have a Vinahouse beat, ""a remix-centric, high-octane variant of EDM similar to Eurodance, that’s pretty much inescapable in Vietnamese clubs.""On the other hand, the song 'De Den De Di"" by singer Le Quang Hung has pop, R&B influences and a catchy chorus while '' (Just Chill) by indie boyband Chillies grabs audiences with the melodic phrase ""da-da-da-da.""Chinese social network and web portal QQ once stated that a unique and memorable melody is the attraction of Vietnamese songs on Douyin.According to musician Khac Hung, local music producers increasingly know how to create a song that is easy to please the audience. They have learned the standards of composition and production from western countries, so many Vietnamese songs are now suited to international tastes.""Foreign record labels like Universal, Sony and Warner Music are now present in Vietnam, which is one of the factors that make it easier to introduce trendy music products abroad,"" he said.Pitchfork noted that Asian culture, such as Japanese anime and K-pop/K-dramas, are getting more popular and being discussed online more but ""perhaps their current popularity will also generate more interest in the culture and aesthetics of countries outside of East Asia.""Choreography is another factor that helps more Vietnamese song attract more global attention.Local DJ/producer KAI, who made the viral song 'Hai Phut Hon' remix, stated that the hip-shake dance helped the song go viral. His remix featured the image of the cartoon character Zero Two shaking her hips to the melody in the music video. This later sparked a social media trend on TikTok where many users made their own cover versions, swaying their hips to the catchy tune.A Chinese woman dances to the tune of '2 Phut Hon' on social media app Douyin. Video by Douyin account BeilajiejieLast year, the song '' (Ghen - jealousy | Co Vy (Ms. Vy) - a local nickname for the new coronavirus) was called a phenomenon by the international media.Billboard said the song went viral because of the hand-washing dance performed by dancer Quang Dang. Just one day after its debut, MC John Oliver covered the dance in the show Last Week Tonight with . A series of famous artists, users around the world responded.Then a popular dancer, Quang Dang, choreographed moves to go with the lyrics that called on people to wash their hands thoroughly and frequently, not to touch their eyes and mouths and limit going to crowded places. The dance sparked a 'Ghen CoVy Challenge' on TikTok, from where it quickly went viral and won high praise from the public for conveying an important message with a catchy song and appealing dance.The development of apps and social networks has contributed to spreading Vietnamese songs to the world.According to Chinese media site Sina, the music was originally used by Tiktok, Douyin accounts in Vietnam or Vietnamese people living and working in China, and then widely shared. The feature of these platforms is that users can create short videos based on available audio, images and effects, which are highly entertaining. Therefore, the need to find and use new and attractive songs is important.Hung said the fact that many Vietnamese songs by young artists are taking international social networks by storm is a good sign but not an impressive achievement.""Many people who use those songs don't hear the lyrics clearly and don't know it's Vietnamese music. They only listen because they have catchy tunes and are different from what they've heard before. They only exploit these songs as background music for TikTok videos or use for other purposes and not to listening to the music,"" he said.","Vietnam,Vietnamese songs,TikTok,TikTok dances,viral songs,Pitchfork"
life,culture,Artist twins overcome ‘sadness of war’ in latest exhibition,"The Le Brothers’ initial intention was to engage with issues like war, violence and memories, but they gradually turned away from such dark subjects to something brighter.This is the assessment of independent curator and art manager Nguyen Anh Tuan, who is curating their latest exhibition at Mo Art Space, a recently opened art venue in Hanoi.The project, now called ‘Illusion’, comprises 19 paintings and six large ceramic vases featuring intricate and interacting layers of figures and patterns that evoke war and culture, ranging from ancient buildings in Hue, carvings on the Nine Tripod Cauldrons - a proud symbol of power of the Nguyen Dynasty - and ancient and modern weapons, to fire clouds and waves, bars and geometrical shapes also inspired by carvings in royal architectural works and other objects.Begun in 2017, ‘Illusion’ is the latest work by Le Ngoc Thanh and Le Duc Hai, who are known for their life-long interest in the themes of war and history and national and personal identities, an interest quite commonamong artists of their generation from the war-torn central region, though perhaps not as persistent as the brothers’.A joint 200cm x 320cm lacquer-on-canvas piece they created later for the ‘Illusion’ project and featuring a bright full-blown vision as against earlier works showing a more violent black and white contrast. Photo courtesy of Nguyen PhongBorn in Quang Binh Province in April 1975 just days before the Vietnam War ended and the country was reunited, and later studying lacquer and oil painting and working in Hue, the pair had opportunely and consistently explored what it means to separate and reunite.Working with various media ranging from painting and installation to performance and video art, the brothers have taken part in numerous international exhibitions, art festivals and events with projects such as the 2011 film ‘Cham Toi Bien’ (Into the Sea) being recognized as important contributions in their fields.Tuan says the 2013 Singapore Biennale for instance devoted a considerable amount of time to introduce ‘Into the Sea’, a 21-minute triple-color channel video which features beautiful natural scenery from Quang Binh to Hue, and in which the brothers’ twin personasembark on a journey to find each other, their homeland and themselves.In 2019, in what was considered an unprecedented effort by four major public art museums in Vietnam to collect contemporary art, the newly established Hue Art Museum acquired a copy of this work, which had earlier been recognized and collected by other notable institutions such as the Singapore Art Museum and Maiiam Contemporary Art Museum in Thailand.In collecting ‘Into the Sea"", the Hue Art Museum also wanted to honor the artists, who in 2008 established one of the first artist-in-residence programs in Vietnam called New Space Arts Foundation.The duo’s latest ‘Illusion’ project, first exhibited in Hue last year, is also a tribute to the former capital, ""a glorious home of art and culture"" which they say deserves a new vision of truth, goodness and beauty rather than just its people’s painful memories of wars.As in their other works, their trademark synchronicity of style is also seen in ‘Illusion’.According to Tuan, who has known the artists for over 10 years, though there are quite a few other pairs or groups collaborating closely, the Le Brothers’ especially intimate connection allows them to paint seamlessly together, with one working on the first layer and the other continuously and spontaneously interacting with it to create the second.Some ‘Illusion’ works on display at Mo Art Space. The exhibition will reopen after the current lockdown ends. Photo courtesy of Nguyen Anh TuanThis joint productivity, with Thanh being more meticulous and Hai more experimental, has given birth to works that can stand either on their own, or together in seemingly endless dialogues between different kinds of polarities such as the edgy and concrete first layer of paint versus the more abstract, blurry and ""illusionary"" quality of the second, the earlier phase featuring intense black-and-white contrast versus the later phase’s softer, brighter and more harmonious colors or the two-dimensional paintings versus three-dimensional vases.In particular, the Le Brothers’ adaptation of high-flown patterns on traditional paintings, which are framed and displayed in a somewhat distant and respectful manner on walls, to familiar everyday objectssuch as vases, which people in the central region use to store items ranging from water to rice, brings art closer to home, Tuan says.The artists plan to continue to adapt their ‘Illusion’ theme to various media such as video art, installation and sculpture. The exploration of painting on vases will also be expanded to other items such as beds, wooden planks, chairs, cupboards, and trays in an ongoing effort to make art accessible and ""at once with audiences"" as they hope.Temporarily closed, the exhibition at Mo Art Space will resume after the current lockdown ends.","Vietnam,Le Brothers,exhibition"

Photo courtesy of TrungWhen HCMC required suspension of social events, gatherings of 20 people or more in one place and of 10 people or more outside workplaces, schools and hospitals, and a minimum distance of two meters between people in public - singer and actor Quang Trung was able to organize an online mini-show at home with his band, attracting more than 300,000 spectators.To do this, he had to squeeze musical instruments, sound equipment and lighting into his apartment. After the mini-show ended on May 29, the city imposed more  the following day, as Trung launched a home cooking series on YouTube.No longer able to hire a professional crew, he asked his relatives to film the show using smartphones. The actor focuses on encouraging the audience to stay active during the pandemic.Movies and game shows are also experimenting with this shooting method. For instance, comedian Truong Giang recorded for the 'Nhanh Nhu Chop' (Lightning Quiz Vietnam) TV program in southern Dong Nai Province after returning here to avoid the pandemic in HCMC. Meanwhile, many TV match making programs have gradually switched to video calling.Actor Huynh Lap also shot and produced a horror series with his manager in his hometown of southern An Giang Province.While shooting at their home is challenging enough, the most difficult thing for artists is ensuring sound and image quality.Nhung only has one dedicated microphone, two livestream lights and a phone for shooting at home. ""The image quality is quite poor when shooting at night and can be unusable sometimes,"" she said.Meanwhile, Giang had to set up a light bulb on a stick and fix it to a fan with tape to replace the light fixture. Lap said, due to a shortage of human resources, he had to mobilize family members to support him. He also asked them not to go back and forth many times because it is easy to mix up the noise.With the online game show recording sessions featuring many guests, internet speed is another factor that can cause disruption to the connection.Comedian Kha Nhu said: ""At the climax of the story, I said a few funny sentences, but it took five or six seconds for the others to hear and respond to my jokes, which might kill the mood of the show.""MC Nguyen Khang also had problems during filming when his phone froze after operating for too long.

The actress has her own car, and gets into it to read the script when there is no scene.Another actress, Minh Cuc, wears protective gear from head to toe whenever she goes to shoot or even discuss a script with someone. She only takes it off when she enters the set. At the end of the shot, she quickly washes her hands, disinfects them and puts back her protective gear.She explains, ""I have young children at home, so I do my best to protect myself and my children.""Director Nguyen Danh Dung says the crew has to get filming licenses and travel passes.

Crew members have to carry their lunch since all eateries are closed.Actor Trung Hieu, who is returning to the small screen after six years, had one of the main scenes shot in an apartment complex. Every time he went in and out, he and his team had to disinfect, make medical declarations and have their temperature screened.""Shooting outdoor scenes was hard since Hanoi was hot the last few days and recorded more and more Covid-19 cases,"" he says.But he is excited nevertheless, joking that ""wearing a mask helps me save time doing makeup.""Many artists film and record at home.Comedian Truong Giang, has also turned his bedroom at home in Dong Nai Province into a movie set for his show ‘Nhanh Nhu Chop Nhi’ (Fast As Lightning).He set up a simple camera, taped a light bulb to a long stick for lighting, and connected and interacted with other artists by video call.Kha Nhu, also a comedian, uses the phones of all his family members to get close-up and panoramic shots.Another comedian, Huynh Lap returned from HCMC to his hometown in An Giang Province months ago to avoid the pandemic.

But since he does not have much expertise, he has to call up colleagues in HCMC and seek their guidance.He says: ""It is very tough in general.

life,culture,Rare representation of Vietnamese cuisine leaves viewers hungry for more,"The ubiquitousness of traditional food in Korean TV dramas, which has contributed to making Korean cuisine world famous, begs the question: Why can’t the local film industry do the same?Ask any Vietnamese viewer about Korean dramas, and they can easily reel off the top of their head a dozen constantly featured Korean dishes such as kimchee, gimpap, seaweed soup, and noodles in black bean sauce.Even better, the Korean film industry, as part of the larger national strategy to export Korean culture known as Hallyu or the Korean Wave, has churned out captivating stories about food, such as the 2003 international hit, ‘Jewel in the Palace,’ a historical series about Dae Jang Geum, Korea’s first female physician who lived in the 16th century and could cure illnesses with medicinal food.To Vietnamese audiences, their cuisine, which has increasingly been praised for its richness and healthiness, certainly deserves to be represented too.Indeed, in recent years popular local dishes such as  (traditional noodles),  (fresh summer rolls) and  (sandwich) have been ranked among the world’s best dishes by media outlets like CNN and Fodor’s Travel.Last year the World Records Union (WorldKings) also recognized five culinary world records set by Vietnam involving dishes such as  and .But while there is no dearth of straightforward YouTube channels, game and reality shows showcasing Vietnamese landscapes, cuisine and recipes such as Taste of Vietnam with American chefs Martin Yan and Robert Danhi, subtler, more symbolic treatment of food in movies and TV dramas remains few and far between.In contemporary films, Vietnamese cuisine earns a few honorable mentions in foreign works such as Alfonso Gomez-Rejon’s 2005 Sundance award-winning movie, ‘Me and Earl and the Dying Girl’ about a quirky high-school boy whose favorite history teacher loves facts and, and Andy Fickman’s sitcom series ‘Kevin Can Wait’ featuring a hilarious restaurant scene in which Kevin, after expressing his skepticism about a bowl of  in front of him, tries the soup and finds it ""insane.""The irresistible  has also appeared in several Korean dramas.It featured in Phan Dang Di’s 2019 film ‘Chang Dang Ca, Nang An Hoa' (He Serves Fish, She Eats Flower), part of HBO’s eight-episode project titled ‘Food Lore’ on Asian culinary traditions, and in a 2015 food and martial arts flick, Nguyen Quoc Duy’s action comedy ‘Kungfu Pho’ about a competition between two families to inherit a secret  recipe.Some well-known award-winning films have also raised the international profile of other Vietnamese dishes.French-Vietnamese director Tran Anh Hung’s idiosyncratic ‘Mui Du Du Xanh' (The Scent of Green Papaya), which won two awards at Cannes in 1993, and his 2000 movie ‘Mua He Chieu Thang Dung' (The Vertical Ray of the Sun) both capture the making of delightful dishes such as green papaya salad, fried pork with Chinese broccoli, baby jackfruit sticky rice, and boiled chicken with slow, close-up and sensuously beautiful photography.Seen through nostalgic lenses, Vietnamese cuisine can take on poignant meanings about cultural and personal identity, as in Vietnamese-American filmmaker Liesl Nguyen’s intimate 2011 short film ‘Thuc Don Ngay Chu Nhat' (Sunday Menu). In this short, a Vietnamese-German teenager can only find herself and pose confidently for a photo after she masters a difficult Lunar New Year dish, , or Vietnamese meat jelly""Thit dong"" or meat jelly, a typical Lunar New Year dish in Liesl Nguyen’s 2011 short film ‘Sunday Menu,’ in which food symbolizes cultural and personal identity. Photo courtesy of the (now defunct) international Yxineff online film festival.In another famous artistic movie, director Nguyen Vinh Son’s ‘Trang Noi Day Gieng' (The Moon at the Bottom of the Well), the culinary art of Vietnam’s last feudal capital Hue takes center stage, unfolding under the meticulous care of its heroine, who epitomizes traditional family values associated with women.In television, many film series have taken the trouble to shoot carefully set up cooking scenes and showcase common Vietnamese dishes, and quite a few also explore culinary themes.Notable examples range from the ground-breaking 2006 Vietnamese-Korean drama ‘Mui Ngo Gai' (Scent of Coriander) about a self-made businesswoman who works her way up from serving as a waitress in a  restaurant, the first drama ever about traditional Vietnamese food, to the 2020 series ‘Vua Banh Mi' (King of Sandwiches), a local remake of the Korean series ‘Bread, Love and Dreams’ known for its director Nguyen Phuong Dien’s efforts to adapt the original’s bread and cakes to Vietnamese sandwiches and reproduce the art of baking as faithfully as possible.However, many people agree that in general the representation of Vietnamese cuisine in films remains scanty and mediocre.Chau Quang Phuoc, a media and film distribution expert who has worked on numerous film projects for BHD, says that this is an undeniable fact, for both filmmakers many of whom are very interested in visually appealing food stories, and local audiences who have high expectations for a culinary tradition well loved and respected by western chefs like Anthony Bourdain.Indeed, food is still mostly treated as a side show - in one table scene or dialogue or another here and there - rather than as a deeper, integral part of characterization and story-telling, and certainly not yet fully explored to create a distinct genre to take pride in.Director Phan Dang Di says with the current state of contemporary Vietnamese films, not just culinary themes, but other important ones such as love, family, politics, and money too tend to be treated in a superficial and trite manner.""We always lack approaches that are personal, interesting, elaborate, and subtle in portraying life unlike in Japanese, Korean, Chinese, Taiwanese or Hong Kong films.""Compared to them, our cinema and television have a bland taste and smell.""According to insiders, the first and foremost difficulty in making culinary, or any film for that matter, is cost. Phuoc says filmmaking is ultimately an expensive game, even for developed film industries, and so funding always remains the most decisive factor.Even the Vietnamese films with the biggest budgets cannot yet be compared with much better invested Thai or Chinese blockbusters in technical quality, special effects, set design, costumes, or props, he points out.Because good culinary films in particular need to be done with care, even need experts’ consultation, and food easily deteriorates and loses colors and requires costly reshooting, many Vietnamese commercial film producers, who already struggle to make profits, would rather opt for safer, more dramatic and popular genres such horror and crime, he says.For making ‘He Serves Fish, She Eats Flower,’ Di and his crew indeed had to hire professional cooks and food stylists to provide training to actors, act in difficult technical scenes and monitor food arrangement that requires plenty of fresh ingredients on hand for repeated reshooting.The film crew also had to hire fishermen in Nha Trang to dive into the sea to catch puffer fish, transport them to HCMC, and keep them alive until the shoot ended, besides ordering a lot of expensive seafood which would be ""impossible to do with average Vietnamese production budgets,"" Di says.There thus seems agreement that to systematically make good culinary films, which Di says can explore the role of Vietnamese cuisine in daily life as well as during famous historical events, filmmakers cannot do it alone, and needsome ambitious, well-coordinate national strategy like the Korean Wave or active sponsorship by cultural authorities.Di strongly supports active government sponsorship of cultural films of which, culinary elements are certainly among the most interesting, worthwhile and curious ones for both domestic and international audiences.He says in many countries, cultural authorities have successfully promoted their cultures through culinary films, so to make really good films about Vietnamese cuisine, ""there is no other way than for us, Vietnamese to work things out together"", he concludes.

Construction took about 20 days with the help of three workers. While building the house, Tu had to make adjustments to the original design. For instance, the leading staircase was initially positioned around the main pillar, but later placed to the side of the house.Instead of chopping down the longan branches, the owner chose to build the house around them and sprayed the area where they perched through with foam to prevent insects from entering and to help stabilize the structure. It is expected that after 1-2 years, this layer of foam would need to be replaced.Inside, the space is clad in pine and cork wood to create a rustic and cozy feeling.All materials were selected with the criteria of being cheap, durable and easy to reuse.
""Therefore, it took me weeks to find the right material,"" the owner said, adding he expects the house to last about 10 years.To keep the house stable, Tu made a steel frame fashioned from a large steel pipe and three small steel equivalents for support.
In order to limit the impact from weather, the owner designed a three-layer roof consisting of palm leaves, foam board insulation and cork.The total cost of the project is about VND130 million (over $5,600). After the house was completed, Tu's two children were delighted with the new place to play.

life,style,Century-old Hanoi ancestral home lifted atop villa,"""This home is more than 100 years old, it is a place filled with many family memories from the lives of my ancestors, parents, children, and even grandchildren,"" Quynh Lien says.It is in the Red River Delta architectural style and has two wings.""My husband and I want to preserve the traditional home but at the same time make changes to create living space for my family.""She does not know the exact year the house was built, but only that her great-grandparents used to live there.The building is about 100 square meters and situated on a plot of land of more than 500 square meters.In 2020, when her family of six needed more space, Lien and her husband decided to build a villa with five floors, each 460 square meters, and move the ancestral house to its top.Since the family of four generations has a tradition of working in art, they wanted the new house to be a mixture of both old and modern.Lien says: ""The house is a work of love, representing family unity and respect for ancestors.""In order to relocate the old house, the family first asked a team of skilled woodworkers to carefully study all its details and components before dismantling every tile, truss and wall.They took the wooden parts to Quoc Oai village to repair and replace if needed.The house was put together exactly like it was before some minor details were added. After the owners checked and were satisfied with the result, the house was disassembled again, taken back to the construction site, lifted up to the fourth floor and built once again.""The two most difficult things were not to break, damage or chip the patterns on the wood and having it restored as close to the original as [possible],"" Lien recalls.Front view of the century-old ancestral house. Photo courtesy of Lien.The owners faced some objections. Some people said the old house should be left on the ground while others said moving it would affect the house's feng shui.But Lien and her husband persisted.The process of moving, restoring and reconstructing the old house took about eight months and cost VND1 billion (over $43,000).The ancestral home has become a place where Lien's relatives, close and distant, gather during holidays, death anniversaries and the Lunar New Year.It is also used to display religious sculptures and has become the new home for Lien's parents-in-law, enabling them enjoy a modern lifestyle while still being close to their grandchildren.Around the ancestral home, the family has planted jackfruit, guava, apple, and star fruit trees and created a feng shui pond as if it is on the ground.Lien says: ""Every morning, afternoon and evening, we come here to exercise, plant trees and prune flowers to relax. The feeling is just like being in the old house where we used to live.""A view of the first floor.

life,style,Fortunate youth spend fortunes on furnishings,"Vu Hai Nam, 26, owns a duplex apartment in Hanoi’s Bac Tu Liem District.Last year, he spent VND2.5 billion ($109,060) to renovate its interiors including an additional VND2.5 billion on furniture. He said a living space must be beautiful, so he was willing to pay the price.His 210 square meter apartment carries an ultra-modern look with reflective materials and imported electronic devices. The refrigerator is one of the most expensive in the market, with a screen displaying photos. It has Nam’s portrait and Bearbricks, pricey bear-shaped plastic figurines that are designed and produced by Japan's MediCom Toy.Architects in Hanoi and Ho Chi Minh City say the trend of single Vietnamese youth, mostly under 30, spending fortunes on doing up their living spaces began around two years ago.This is starkly different from the behavior of the previous generation, when couples got married before buying houses. It is also the behavior of a privileged section of society in a country where owning a home remains a distant dream for many.Dung Phan, a Hanoi-based architect, said that 80 percent of his clients these days were single, aged 25 to 30, up from around 50 percent a couple of years ago. Most of them are successful and open-minded youngsters, earning a lot of money, having good taste, and actively looking for advice from architects and experts, he said.Nam earns his living trading in luxury goods.The money the youth are willing to spend on their houses has increased exponentially, said architect Vo Luan. He said single Vietnamese now can pay up to VND1 billion for an apartment’s furniture, compared to just VND200 - 300 million a few years ago.Nguyen Viet Linh, who designed Nam’s apartment, said he has just finished doing up a 100-meter-square apartment for a 25-year-old female client for VND 1.1 billion.Many clients have paid up to VND3 billion for sofas from Italy, or VND800 million for imported sanitary ware, he said.""Showing off luxury brands and cars is an outdated activity. Now, successful youngsters show off their houses,"" Linh said.""When you post photographs of a house and its interiors, people can guess how much you spent,"" he said, adding that the more people want to show off with complicated and sophisticated designs, the higher their spending.Last year, Vu Thu Phuong, a 29-year-old English teacher who runs her own center, bought a 100 square meter apartment in Ba Dinh District. At that time, Japanese-style houses with sliding doors and built-in wardrobes were the in thing, but she did not want to do something that was popular. So she approached an architect to design something completely different.The architect removed a partition wall completely. The entire plaster ceiling was also removed and electric wires with fireproof metal were installed.""The ceiling alone cost VND100 million,"" Phuong revealed.The interior renovation, which is a combination of industrial and mid-century styles, took six months to complete, and cost her nearly VND900 million, not including electronic equipment. Phuong thinks it was worth it, because ""everyone compliments me that the house is unique.""Some experts are guessing that another factor for young people willing to spend money on a house is the pandemic. Staying at home with very few opportunities for vacationing, people have turned their attention to doing up their homes.""Many homeowners have asked for the house to be like a resort,"" said architect Vo Luan.Luan said in wanting ""a house similar to a resort,"" young single homeowners accept spending a fortune to renovate the ""rough"" part of their houses, which many people often avoid in order to save money.For example, some people want to have green areas and glasses walls for a transparent and airy space. ""They also like to have a relaxing corner even if the living space is not large, and pay more attention to interior materials,"" Luan said.Many young homeowners want to have glass walls and big windows that let in a lot of natural light. Photo by Abluebird Photography/Angelo Design.The popularity of social networks and netizens showing off their houses also triggers the desire among other youth to have beautiful homes, some studies have found.Designer Dung Phan said some people see others’ houses and try to follow them, buying a lot of luxurious furniture.""Of course, these are just a minority,"" said Dung.Nam’s purpose in spending billions of dong on furniture is to live in a decent house, he said. He hopes to buy a villa or penthouse of 500-600 square meters with a swimming pool by the age of 30.Phuong did not post photos of her home on social networks, only sending some to her close friends. Her current goal is to buy five lamps designed by famous American artist Isamu Noguchi, the cheapest of which costs $400.""They are made of paper and have comfortable yellow light,"" she said, adding that she does not care when people say she is being frivolous and ostentatious.""I want to have a house which is so relaxing that I can meditate everywhere, so I will try to buy anything I like.""","architecture,Vietnamese,apartment,house,young people"

world,world,Thailand joins nations banning entry from Africa over Covid Omicron variant,"Starting in December, travel from Botswana, Eswatini, Lesotho, Malawi, Mozambique, Namibia, South Africa and Zimbabwe, will be prohibited, senior health official Opas Karnkawinpong told a news conference.Thailand will not allow travelers from these countries to register to travel to Thailand starting on Saturday, he said.The announcement comes as the U.S. and other countries in Asia tighten borders over worries about the B 1.1.529 variant. The World Health Organization designated it the latest ""variant of concern,"" saying it may spread more quickly than other forms.""We have notified airlines and these countries,"" Opas said adding that travelers from other African countries will not be allowed to use the country's quarantine-free travel scheme for vaccinated travelers.Japan's Foreign Ministry said on Saturday the country will tighten border controls for the southern African nations of Mozambique, Malawi and Zambia, requiring a 10-day quarantine for any entrants.The new rules will take effect from midnight (1500 GMT on Saturday) and come a day after Japan tightened border controls for those arriving from South Africa, Botswana, Eswatini, Zimbabwe, Namibia and Lesotho.The U.S. also announced to bar entry to most travelers from the eight southern African countries starting on Monday.The new variant poses a new challenge for President Joe Biden, who has had a mixed success getting Americans vaccinated after a politically motivated pushback by 10 states. Biden also faces criticism from international health experts and foreign leaders for failing to send vaccines to poorer countries.The travel restrictions do not ban flights or apply to U.S. citizens and lawful U.S. permanent residents.No cases of Omicron were identified in the United States to date, according to Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) on Friday. The agency expects that it would identify the B.1.1.529 variant quickly, if it emerges in the country.Countries around the world rushed to suspend travel from southern Africa after the World Health Organization said Omicron was ""of concern."" Many of those bans kick in immediately, unlike those issued by Biden.Most non-U.S. citizens who have been in those countries within the prior 14 days will not be allowed into the United States.Biden made the announcement while spending the Thanksgiving holiday weekend on the Massachusetts island of Nantucket.""As a precautionary measure until we have more information, I am ordering additional air travel restrictions from South Africa and seven other countries,"" Biden said in a statement.Sri Lanka said on Saturday it was barring travellers from the six southern African countries on Saturday over concerns about the new Omicron variant.From Monday, travelers will not be allowed into the country from South Africa, Botswana, Zimbabwe, Namibia, Lesotho and Eswatini.Travelers who arrived from these six countries over the past two days will have to undergo mandatory 14 days quarantine.Australia also imposed new restrictions on Saturday on people who have been to nine southern African countries: South Africa, Namibia, Zimbabwe, Botswana, Lesotho, Eswatini, the Seychelles, Malawi and Mozambique.Effective immediately, the government will ban non-citizens who have been in those countries from entering and will require supervised 14-day quarantines for Australian citizens and their dependents returning from the countries, said Health Minister Greg Hunt.These restrictions also apply to people such as international students and skilled migrants arriving from countries with which Australia has travel bubbles, who have been in any of the nine countries within the past 14 days.""If the medical evidence shows that further actions are required, we will not hesitate to take them. And that may involve strengthening or expanding the restrictions,"" he said.Anyone who has already arrived in Australia and who has been in any of those countries within the past 14 days must immediately isolate and be tested.The Australian government will also suspend all flights from the nine southern African countries for two weeks.Twenty travelers from South Africa are in quarantine in the Northern Territory's Howard Springs facility, 19 of whom have returned negative coronavirus tests. It is not yet known if the one positive test result is the Omicron variant, Hunt said.The World Health Organization on Friday declared the new coronavirus variant to be ""of concern.""It was first reported to the WHO from South Africa on Wednesday and has been identified in Botswana, Belgium, Hong Kong and Israel.","Thailand,Covid-19,coronavirus,variant,Omicron,travel restrictions,ban of entry,Africa"
world,world,US health panel says Merck pill can prevent grave Covid infections,"But the report, from an FDA advisory panel, cautioned that pregnant women should not use the drug, known as molnupiravir, saying the potential benefits do not outweigh the risks for those patients.The report is meant to provide guidance to an FDA experts panel convening Tuesday to consider whether to authorize emergency use of molnupiravir.Approval, analysts say, would represent a major step forward in the ongoing battle against the global pandemic, handing healthcare professionals a powerful new tool to help those infected.Merck said last month that the drug, in a clinical trial, had been found to halve the rate of hospitalizations and deaths in high-risk Covid patients who took it soon after infection.The preliminary FDA report confirmed the drug's effectiveness in patients with mild to moderate Covid or at risk of hospitalization.In adding a caution against the drug's use by pregnant women, the report noted that no pregnant women were included in the clinical trials.But it said tests involving pregnant rats and rabbits found higher rates of developing underweight and malformed fetuses after taking the drug.It cited ""both known and possibly unknown risks ... in pregnant or lactating individuals and pediatric patients.""Merck, in its authorization request, said its data stemmed from trials conducted in partnership with Ridgeback Biotherapeutics in people with mild to moderate cases of Covid-19 and with at least one additional risk factor.They were given the drug within five days of symptoms first appearing.The hospitalization rate among patients who received the drug was 7.3 percent, compared to 14.1 percent for those given a placebo.Not one of those treated died, while the second group saw eight deaths.The positive results were considered persuasive enough that an independent data review committee decided, in consultation with the FDA, to halt the drug trial ahead of schedule.Antiviral drugs like molnupiravir work by reducing the ability of a virus to reproduce itself.The drugs may be useful not only in keeping infected people from developing more serious symptoms, but in preventing people who have had prolonged exposure to the virus from falling ill.The pill can be dispensed by a pharmacy and taken at home, whereas the three authorized monoclonal antibodies authorized for treating mild to moderate Covid-19 in at-risk individuals must be administered intravenously or through injection, the FDA report noted.","Covid infections,anti-Covid pill,Merck"
world,world,Top US diplomat for Asia to visit four ASEAN countries,"Daniel Kritenbrink, the assistant secretary of state for East Asia, will be in the region from Saturday until Dec. 4, a State Department statement said.U.S. Ambassador to Vietnam Daniel Kritenbrink speaks to the press in Hanoi, Vietnam, September 2020. Photo by VnExpress/Giang HuyKritenbrink would ""reaffirm the U.S. commitment to work together ... to tackle the most serious global and regional challenges"" and stress U.S. support for ""a rules-based order in the Indo-Pacific,"" it said, a reference to China's increasingly assertive behavior in the region, which Washington has repeatedly denounced as ""coercive.""Kritenbrink will discuss human rights ""challenges,"" seek to bolster cooperation on climate change and discuss ways to pressure Myanmar's military government to cease violence and allow unhindered humanitarian access, the statement said.He will also discuss how to strengthen economic relationships and ""build back better"" from the Covid-19 pandemic, it said.Biden joined leaders of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) in a virtual summit last month, the first time in four years Washington had engaged at the top level with the bloc.He pledged to stand with ASEAN in defending freedom of the seas and democracy, and said Washington would start talks on developing a regional economic framework, something critics say his Asia strategy has lacked since his predecessor Donald Trump quit a regional trade pact.An Asian diplomat said regional countries were still awaiting details of this plan, recognizing Biden's focus on rebuilding domestic economic strength was a limiting factor.Daniel Russel, a predecessor of Kritenbrink in the Obama administration, said a key question for ASEAN was ""whether the United States truly has a viable economic strategy"" for the region.""The pledge to discuss ways to strengthen U.S. economic engagement with ASEAN countries is music to their ears, even if they may be underwhelmed by the 'economic framework' so far,"" he said.Kritenbrink's trip announcement stressed the ""centrality"" of the 10-member ASEAN to regional affairs, but he will not visit the bloc's new chair, Cambodia, which has shifted ever closer to China.The Asian diplomat and Russel said Kritenbrink was likely to visit other ASEAN countries before long and Russel noted Indonesia's capital Jakarta is home to the bloc's permanent headquarters.""While it is important to discuss the ASEAN agenda with the 2022 chair, visiting ASEAN headquarters in Jakarta will afford him the opportunity to begin that conversation,"" Russel said.","ASEAN,US,U.S. diplomat for East Asia,Daniel Kritenbrink"

life,style,Businesswoman cultivates rose garden of nearly 500 species,"Early each morning, the 42-year-old wakes up to the sound of birds chirping. As they flock to her garden, the scent of roses drifts through the window into her bedroom.
The owner of the garden grows excited on seeing the Dream Light Rose she loves in full bloom. ""Walking in my own flower garden, I feel like I'm lost in a mystical paradise,"" said the female director of a cable television branch in Bao Loc Town, Central Highlands' Lam Dong Province.In 2010, she moved with her mother and two daughters from Saigon to Bao Loc to live due to a change in work. She bought a 300-square-meter strip of land for VND1.8 billion, used a third of the area to build a house, and two parts for gardening.
Having visited many rose gardens while in Europe, Suong wished one day to have a beautiful flower garden for herself. But due to a busy schedule, she did not pick up gardening until 2015.Suong spent a chunk of her time hunting for different kinds of roses both at home and abroad, including Thai and Vietnamese grafts, along with other plant species.
To import rare rose varieties from Europe, she had to place orders through a middle man. In 2015, the price of bare-root roses from abroad was around VND1.2-2 million per plant while roses imported from mountain resort town Sa Pa cost VND10 million.
Everything in the garden was desgined by herself, from paving the walkway to installing flower arches.
""I often get scratches on my hands from thorns, but since I love flowers so much, I keep gardening every day,"" she said, adding she works on improving the garden whenever she has spare time.At first, she thought that using a lot of fertilizer would help her roses grow faster. Unexpectedly, more than 40 imported rose plants withered and died, wasting more than VND80 million worth of seedlings. After this painful lesson, she read more to gain experience in caring for her garden""For newly bought or weak plants, I have to cut all flowers, prune the branches and change the soil. For best results, I use rice husks, cow dung, coir and mix them in with the soil,"" Suong revealed.
Later, the rose bushes are watered every three days to stimulate root growth. When the plant sprouts new shoots, she follows up by incorporating some organic fertilizer, watering the roots once a week, spraying fungicides right after planting and others.
To treat mealybugs, the gardener mixes dishwashing liquid with cooking oil, rubbing solution onto the leaves with a toothbrush. If there are red spiders, she will use a spray to wash the leaves.
She designed the garden in European style. In order for the roses to have enough space to grow, she had to cut down many trees.
Currently, the garden has a total 450 species of roses, with total costs reaching more than VND300 million. But she said she will not stop here. Every time there is a new variety, she orders and adds it to her garden.Suong knows the names of all types of roses in the garden, along with their properties and methods of care.
""Mac spice roses from New Zealand have been bred and domesticated in Vietnam, the flowers usually bloom in clusters, small in size and mild in scent,"" she noted.The white Friendship rose varieties were planted by the gate since it helps form an arche thanks to its strong vining ability and because its flowers bloom in clusters pefect for decoration.
Suong often takes photos of her rose garden and posts it to online flower-loving groups, where many other flower enthusiasts ask her for advice on how to care for flowers, treat worms, aphids and others.While many families opted to travel for the Reunification Day (April 30) and Labor Day (May 1) holidays, Suong and her family just played around in her garden and observed the beauty of the flowers.
""Every 35 days, there will be a new blooming period. As birds start chirping again, life suddently feels more brighter and livelier,"" she said.","Vietnam,rose garden,gardening,Lam Dong Province"
world,world,"China CO2 emissions fall for first time since Covid rebound, report says","The world's biggest emitter of greenhouse gases saw CO2 emissions drop by around 0.5 percent in July-September from a year earlier, Lauri Myllyvirta, lead analyst with the Helsinki-based Centre for Research on Energy and Clean Air (CREA), said.""The drop in emissions could mark a turning point and an early peak in China's total emissions, years ahead of its target to peak before 2030,"" Myllyvirta said in a report published on Carbon Brief on Thursday.The fall marks a turnaround from an approximately 9 percent increase in emissions in the first half of 2021, when China's post-Covid-19 economic recovery was in full swing with construction and heavy industrial activity.The last time China's quarterly emissions fell year-on-year was in January-March 2020, when Covid-19 first hit.Although researchers had pointed out that China's major industries could reach carbon peaks by around 2024 and called for a cap on total emissions by 2025, its top climate negotiators did not make any more ambitious pledges in the U.N. talks in Glasgow that ended earlier this month.Tight coal supply and record-high prices caused power outages in many Chinese regions late in the third quarter, hitting industrial operations and disrupting residential usage.Meanwhile, production of two major building materials, crude steel and cement, slowed by 16 percent and 11 percent, respectively, from the previous three months, according to a calculation based on China's statistics bureau data.China has tightened property curbs amid concerns over the potential collapse of highly indebted firms such as China Evergrande Group and a possible spillover of credit risk into the broader economy.""If the Chinese government injects further construction stimulus to boost its economy, emissions could rebound once again, before peaking later this decade,"" Myllyvirta said.","China,environment,Covid-19,coronavirus,pollution,emission,carbon dioxide,climate"

world,world,27 die in Channel's deadliest migrant boat tragedy,"President Emmanuel Macron vowed France would not allow the Channel to become a ""cemetery"" and also spoke to British Prime Minister Boris Johnson to agree on stepping up efforts to thwart the traffickers blamed for the surge in crossings.""It is Europe's deepest values -- humanism, respect for the dignity of each person -- that are in mourning,"" Macron said.The disaster caused the highest death toll since at least 2018 when migrants began using boats en masse to cross the Channel. It comes as tensions grow between London and Paris over the record numbers of people crossing.Prosecutors opened a manslaughter probe after the boat sank off the northern port city of Calais. Interior Minister Gerald Darmanin said four suspected traffickers accused of being directly linked to the doomed crossing in a long inflatable boat had been arrested.Darmanin told reporters in Calais that only two survivors had been found and both of their lives were in danger. He said five women and one little girl were among those who died, while Calais mayor Natacha Bouchart said a pregnant woman was also one of the victims.The nationality of the migrants was not immediately clear. An initial toll said 31 migrants had died but the interior ministry later revised this down to 27.Prime Minister Jean Castex will hold a crisis meeting early on Thursday, his office said.French officials said earlier three helicopters and three boats had searched the area, uncovering corpses and people unconscious in the water, after a fisherman sounded the alarm.Johnson said he was ""shocked, appalled and deeply saddened by the loss of life at sea"", following a crisis meeting with senior officials.But he also said Britain had faced ""difficulties persuading some of our partners, particularly the French, to do things in a way that the situation deserves"".Britain has urged tougher action from France to stop migrants from making the voyage.The issue has added to growing post-Brexit strains between Britain and France, with a row on fishing rights also still unresolved.""The response must obviously also come from Britain,"" said Darmanin, calling for ""a very tough coordinated international response"".In telephone talks, Johnson and Macron agreed on the ""urgency of stepping up joint efforts to prevent these deadly crossings"" and that ""it is vital to keep all options on the table"" to break the business model of the smuggling gangs, according to Downing Street.One of the French lifeboat workers, Charles Devos, described seeing ""a flat, deflated inflatable boat with the little air that remained helping it float"" surrounded by bodies of the drowned.Pierre Roques of the Auberge des Migrants NGO in Calais said the Channel risked becoming as deadly as the Mediterranean, which has seen a much higher toll from the migrants crossing.""People are dying in the Channel, which is becoming a cemetery. And as England is right opposite, people will continue to cross,"" he said.According to the French authorities, 31,500 people attempted to leave for Britain since the start of the year and 7,800 people have been rescued at sea, figures which doubled since August.In Britain, Johnson's Conservative government is coming under intense pressure, including from its own supporters, to reduce the numbers.Natalie Elphicke, the Conservative MP for the British Channel port of Dover, called the sinking ""an absolute tragedy"" and demonstrated the need to stop the crossings at their source.""As winter is approaching, the seas will get rougher, the water colder, the risk of even more lives tragically being lost greater,"" she said.Charlotte Kwantes of Utopia56, an association that works with migrants in Calais, said ""more than 300"" migrants had died since 1999 in the area.""As long as safe passages are not put in place between England and France, or as long as these people cannot be regularized in France... there will be deaths at the border,"" she told .According to British authorities, more than 25,000 people have now arrived illegally so far this year, already triple the figure recorded in 2020.","27 deaths,France,England,Channel,President Emmanuel Macron"
world,world,Europe must act 'urgently' amid dire Covid outlook,"The agency spoke out a day after the WHO Europe warned that 700,000 more may die across Europe and Central Asia this winter.With more than 2.5 million cases and almost 30,000 deaths reported in the past week, Europe is by far the region currently worst hit by the virus, according to 's tally.The trend is increasing, especially in countries with the lowest vaccination rates.Europe's return to the pandemic's epicenter has been blamed on sluggish vaccine uptake in some nations, the highly contagious Delta variant, colder weather moving people indoors again and the easing of restrictions.In addition, evidence is growing that vaccine-induced protection against infection and mild disease is waning, prompting calls for booster shots.Some countries in Europe have already reintroduced strict measures while others are poised to do so, sparking protests from people weary of having their lives restricted over the past year-and-a-half.Faced with a rising tide of cases France and Italy said they would increase the rollout of booster shots for all adults as Italian Prime Minister Mario Draghi and French government spokesman Gabriel Attal noted a slight but constant ""deterioration"" in the Covid situation.Rome decreed unvaccinated people may not go to bars or restaurants, theaters, discos or gyms from December 6 to January 15.

Photo by AFPOn Tuesday, the European branch of the World Health Organization warned up to 700,000 more people could die from Covid-19 by March in Europe and Central Asia, in addition to the 1.5 million who have already succumbed to the virus.The WHO said it expected ""high or extreme stress"" in intensive care units (ICUs) in 49 out of the 53 countries that comprise its European region this winter.The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) on Wednesday said its modeling predicted an equally grim outcome unless measures were taken ""urgently"".""The potential burden of disease in the EU/EEA from the Delta variant will be very high in December and January unless public health measures are applied now in combination with continued efforts to increase vaccine uptake in the total population,"" it said in a statement.Under 70 percent of the overall population in the EU and the European Economic Area (Norway, Liechtenstein and Iceland) have been fully vaccinated.""This leaves a large vaccination gap that cannot be bridged rapidly and gives ample room for the virus to spread,"" the ECDC said.""We need to urgently focus on closing this immunity gap, offer booster doses to all adults, and reintroduce non-pharmaceutical measures,"" ECDC director Andrea Ammon said.In the EU overall, 67.7 percent of the population is fully vaccinated but vaccination levels vary widely between countries.Only 24.2 percent of Bulgarians are fully vaccinated compared to 86.7 percent in Portugal.Ammon recommended Covid booster shots for all adults over the age of 18, ""with a priority for people above 40 years old"".EU chief Ursula von der Leyen on Wednesday echoed that call, tweeting that ""boosters should be available for adults, with priority for people over 40 and vulnerable people.""Sweden, which has already offered boosters to those over the age of 65, meanwhile announced it would soon be making them available to those aged 18 to 64.It will start with those in the age group 50 to 64, Health Minister Lena Hallengren told reporters.Countries in central and eastern Europe are currently seeing the highest number of deaths, due to low vaccination rates.In Russia, doctors on Wednesday invited celebrities and politicians with anti-vaccine views to visit Covid red zones in hospitals and see for themselves the dramatic effects of the pandemic.""We are all somewhat busy, you can probably guess with what,"" said the letter. Signatories included prominent Moscow doctor Denis Protsenko, who is in charge of the capital's main Covid hospital.Despite multiple pleas from President Vladimir Putin, only 37 percent of Russians are fully vaccinated and the country has seen more than 1,000 deaths a day in recent weeks.","Europe,Covid,surging cases,measures,deaths,vaccine"

The bill has been scaled down substantially from Democrats' initial $3.5 trillion plan but still aims to invest millions to expand education, lower healthcare costs and tackle climate change.The vote comes after Republican House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy spoke for a record-setting 8-1/2 hours starting late Thursday night in remarks cataloging a list of Republican grievances - some related to the bill and some not - while at times shouting over Democrats in the House who were openly dismissive.In a dig at McCarthy, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi began her speech supporting the bill by saying ""As a courtesy to my colleagues, I will be brief.""""Much has been said on this floor.

world,world,Oil rises as investors look past possible reserve releases,"Brent crude was up 73 cents, or 0.9 per cent, at US$81.97 a barrel by 7.03am GMT (3.03pm, Singapore time), after falling to a six-week low on Thursday before rebounding to close 1.2 per cent higher.US West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude for December delivery was up 82 cents, or 1 per cent, at US$79.83 a barrel, having swung through a more than US$2 range the previous session before closing up.The December contract expires on Friday and most trading activity has shifted to the January future, which was up 67 cents, or 0.9 per cent, at US$79.08 a barrel.Both Brent and WTI are set for a fourth week of declines.The market gyrations on Thursday followed a Reuters report that the United States had asked China, Japan and other big buyers to join a release of crude stocks from Strategic Petroleum Reserves (SPR).Any release ""would only provide a short-term fix to a structural deficit"", Goldman Sachs oil analysts said in a note. A move to supply oil to the market is now fully priced-in at any rate, they said, adding a release ""would not help the slow global supply response that only higher oil prices can overcome"".The Biden administration's push for a coordinated release of oil stockpiles has been seen as a signal to the OPEC+ production group that it should raise output to address concerns of high fuel prices in the world's biggest economies, starting with the United States, China and Japan.Brent has surged almost 60 per cent this year, recently driven by a wider energy crunch as economies recover from the COVID-19 pandemic at the same time as the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC), and allies, known as OPEC+, has raised output only gradually.The market structure for Brent remains backwardated, which is when prompt prices are higher than later-dated futures. That typically indicates that oil demand is higher than supply and is considered bullish for prices.However, the backwardation has decreased amid the swings over the last two sessions, a sign the tightness in the market is easing.The price difference between the front-month Brent crude contract and the one for six months later was US$4.30 a barrel, down from an eight-year high of US$6.30 earlier this month. Physical crude markets also showed some easing, traders said.OPEC has maintained what analysts say is unprecedented restraint on production, even as prices have rebounded from the depths of the early stages of the coronavirus pandemic.Data showing Saudi Arabia's oil exports hit an eight-month high in September, rising for a straight fifth month, also helped keep prices in check.Nonetheless, ""the market remains fundamentally tight and any volumes released are unlikely to substantially alter the global balance"", Fitch Solutions commodities analysts said.

world,world,"Japan eyes record stimulus Package, bucking global tapering trend","This bucks a global trend towards withdrawing crisis-mode stimulus measures and adding strains to its already tattered finances.Spending ballooned from an array of payouts including those criticized as unrelated to the pandemic, such as cash handouts to households with youth aged 18 or below, and will likely lead to additional bond issuance this year, analysts said.The massive spending would underscore the resolve of Prime Minister Fumio Kishida - once considered as favoring fiscal restraint - to focus on reflating the economy and redistributing wealth to households.""The reflationary monetary policy and go-big-or-go-home fiscal policy pioneered by (former Premier) Shinzo Abe is now the orthodoxy,"" said James Brady, an analyst at Teneo.""Though Kishida has been known in the past for being somewhat hawkish, he appears set to continue the Abenomics paradigm for several more years.""Bond yields ticked up on Thursday after the Nikkei newspaper reported the new stimulus package will include record spending of about 55.7 trillion yen ($488 billion), much bigger than 30-40 trillion yen estimated by markets.The total package, which includes funds that do not lead to immediate spending, will likely reach 78.9 trillion yen, the paper said without citing sources.Kishida will announce the package later on Friday and compile an extra budget, expected around 32 trillion yen, to fund part of the cost, the Asahi Shimbun daily reported on Friday.Aside from issuing debt, the government will tap 4.5 trillion yen in reserves set aside for emergency pandemic spending, the paper said.Japan has lagged other economies in pulling out of pandemic-induced doldrums, forcing policymakers to maintain massive fiscal and monetary support even as other advanced nations dial back crisis-mode policies.Policymakers hope the new spending will help underpin the economy, which shrank more than expected in the third quarter due to the hit to consumption and exports from pandemic curbs and global supply disruptions.Japan's three massive spending packages to counter the pandemic have left it with outstanding long-term debt roughly double the size of its $5 trillion economy.","Japan,stimulus package,Covid-19,pandemic"
world,world,AstraZeneca's preventative Covid-19 shot shown to work longer-term,"The therapy, called AZD7442 or Evusheld, had previously been shown to confer 77 percent protection against symptomatic illness after three months, in an earlier readout of the late-stage PROVENT trial in August.The Anglo-Swedish company also said a separate study in patients with mild-to-moderate Covid-19 showed a higher dose of AZD7442 cut the risk of symptoms worsening by 88 percent when given within three days of first symptoms.The treatment is given in one go, as two sequential shots in the arm.The latest results from the longer-term follow-ups potentially position AstraZeneca, like rival Pfizer as a future supplier of both Covid-19 vaccines and treatments, with AstraZeneca having said the therapy's ""real advantage"" was as a preventative shot.Pfizer has presented promising efficacy data on its oral Covid-19 treatment candidate, which can be more easily distributed than injections, and is also a leading vaccine supplier with partner BioNTech.""These new data add to the growing body of evidence supporting AZD7442's potential ... We are progressing regulatory filings around the world and look forward to providing an important new option against SARS-CoV-2 as quickly as possible,"" AstraZeneca Executive Vice President Mene Pangalos said in a statement, referring to the coronavirus that causes Covid-19.The group last month sought approval for the medicine from U.S. and European authorities. Monoclonal antibodies from Regeneron, Lilly and GSK-Vir have been approved by U.S. regulators for treating unhospitalised Covid-19 patients.For AstraZeneca's PROVENT trial, close to 5,200 participants without an infection were randomly split into two groups, with one volunteer receiving an ineffective placebo without knowing for every two receiving Evusheld.Participants were at risk of suffering severe Covid-19 if infected or were immunocompromised, meaning they were in cancer care, or receiving drugs due to an autoimmune disease or an organ transplant.The trial volunteers were not vaccinated, even though high-risk groups have been prioritised in global vaccination campaigns. Anyone opting to get vaccinated during the trial was excluded from the analysis.AstraZeneca has said the shot is primarily meant to help immunocompromised and at-risk individuals but at some point a wider group could benefit, such as military personnel on tours of duty or cruise ship passengers.It added that about 2 percent of the global population was considered to inadequately respond to a Covid-19 vaccine.Trial volunteers will be followed up for 15 months to provide evidence of longer-lasting protection.Evusheld belongs to a drug category that is based on monoclonal antibodies which are lab-made proteins that mimic the body's natural defences. They are based on antibodies that the human body produces in response to infection or vaccination.","Covid-19,coronavirus,AstraZeneca,vaccine,vaccination,antiviral"

Such a release could be in the form of a sale or a loan from the U.S. Strategic Petroleum Reserve - or both.The SPR was set up in the 1970s after the Arab Oil Embargo to ensure the United States has adequate supply to weather an emergency.Several people familiar with the matter cautioned that negotiations over a coordinated supply release have not been finalized nor has any final decision been made about whether to pursue any specific course of action on oil prices.The White House declined to comment on the detailed content of conversations with other countries.""No decisions have been made,"" said a spokesperson for the White House's National Security Council.For weeks, the White House has said it is ""talking with other energy consumers to ensure global energy supply and prices do not imperil the global economic recovery,"" the spokesperson added.After Reuters reported on the White House discussions, U.S. crude futures were trading at $78.18, down from a close of $78.36 a barrel, while Brent fell to $80.21 after ending at $80.28 a barrel.Prior to the news, both U.S. crude and global benchmark Brent notched their lowest settlement prices since early October, with Brent down 1.7 percent and U.S. crude down 3 percent for the day.OPEC, led by Saudi Arabia and its allies led by Russia, have been adding around 400,000 barrels per day to the market on a monthly basis, but have resisted Biden's calls for more rapid increases, arguing the rebound in demand could be fragile.OPEC Secretary General Mohammad Barkindo said on Tuesday he expected a global supply surplus to emerge as soon as December.""These are signals that we have to be very, very careful,"" he told reporters.Rising oil prices have vexed Biden ahead of the 2022 midterm elections which will determine whether his Democratic party maintains its slim majorities in the U.S. Congress.U.S. gasoline prices average $3.41 per gallon now, according to AAA, more than 60 percent higher than a year ago as the economy has rebounded from the Covid-19 pandemic.Several Biden aides attribute his falling public approval ratings in recent months to worsening inflation from energy to food and other areas. The consumer price index is up 6.2 percent over the last 12 months, with its energy components up 30 percent.The Paris-based International Energy Agency, an energy watchdog which includes some of the largest consumers of oil, including the United States, Japan, and numerous European nations, did not comment. The IEA in the past has coordinated releases involving several countries.""The IEA monitors the oil market closely and stands ready to act as necessary,"" it said in a statement.","US,Japan,China,oil,energy"
world,world,Hush in South Korea as students sit high-stakes exam,"Locally known as ""Suneung"", the nine-hour test is crucial not only for securing spots in top universities, but is also considered key for elevated social status, lucrative careers and even marriage prospects.The enormous pressure on students in South Korea's ultra-competitive education system has been blamed for teenage depression and suicide rates that are among the highest in the world.One parent was keen to ease the stress ahead of the 2021 exam.""I just want to tell my daughter that I'm proud of her for working so hard up until this point, and that this test, regardless of the result, doesn't define who she is as a person,"" Koh Min-soon, the mother of a test-taker, told AFP on Wednesday.Since last year, Covid-19 has added to the pressure on students, parents and education authorities.All classes became online for exam takers in the two weeks leading up to the test, while the students and their families were advised to stay at home as much as possible in that time.More than 509,000 students are taking the test this year, the education ministry said.Throughout the exam, which started at 8:40 am, students will be required to wear face masks.South Korea is among the leading nations in Covid-19 vaccinations -- close to 80 percent of the population has been fully jabbed -- but it has seen a surge in cases in the run-up to the exam.Students arriving for the test were checked, and those showing Covid symptoms would have to take it in separate designated spaces.Some 70 students will sit the exam despite recently testing positive for the coronavirus, at medical facilities with desks and chairs specially prepared for them.The national importance of the exam is reflected in the extraordinary measures South Korean authorities take to remove any disturbance for test-takers.Public offices, banks and the stock market open an hour later than usual to help ease traffic and ensure students arrive on time for the exam.All take-offs and landings at the country's airports are suspended for 35 minutes during an English listening test. All planes in the air must maintain an altitude higher than 3,000 meters (10,000 feet).The South Korean transport ministry said 79 flights -- 16 of them international -- have been rescheduled because of the exam.Police car and motorbike escorts were available in school areas for any students stuck in traffic or running late.""It's a very important day for the test takers, and the past year has been very tough for them,"" an official at the National Police Agency told  before the exam.""So we are just trying to do what we can to show support.""","South Korea,South Korean,education,students,exam,examination"

world,world,Pfizer files for US authorization of promising Covid-19 antiviral pill,"Pfizer said it completed submission of its application for emergency use authorization (EUA) of the drug, Paxlovid, with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, including data from the drugmaker's clinical trial.The oral drug could be a promising new weapon in the fight against the pandemic, as it can be taken as an early at-home treatment to help prevent Covid-19 hospitalizations and deaths. It could also become a important tool in countries and areas with limited access to vaccines or low vaccination rates.It is not immediately clear when U.S. regulators will rule on Pfizer's application. Merck & Co and Ridgeback Biotherapeutics, which are developing a competing pill, molnupiravir, completed their EUA submission on Oct. 11.""We are moving as quickly as possible in our effort to get this potential treatment into the hands of patients, and we look forward to working with the U.S. FDA on its review of our application, along with other regulatory agencies around the world,"" Pfizer Chief Executive Albert Bourla said in a news release.The New York-based drugmaker said it has begun the process of seeking authorization of the treatment in several countries including the United Kingdom, Australia, New Zealand and South Korea, and plans further international submissions.Pfizer has said it expects to manufacture 180,000 treatment courses by the end of next month and at least 50 million courses by the end of 2022.The company earlier on Tuesday said it will allow generic manufacturers to supply its Covid-19 pill to 95 low- and middle-income countries through a licensing agreement with international public health group Medicines Patent Pool (MPP).","antiviral pill,Covid-19,Pfizer"
world,world,AstraZeneca-Oxford Covid-19 vaccine supply hits two billion doses,"The shot, which is the biggest contributor to the Covax vaccine sharing scheme backed by the World Health Organization, is being made in 15 countries for supply to more than 170 countries, London-listed AstraZeneca and Oxford University said in a joint statement.AstraZeneca in June last year signed on India's Serum Institute, the world's biggest manufacturer of vaccines by volume, to help double the vaccine's manufacturing capacity to two billion doses.The ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 shot, sold under the brand names Vaxzevria and Covishield, has faced challenges around efficacy data, supplies and links to rare blood clots.AstraZeneca last week said as the world learns to live with the coronavirus which causes Covid-19, it would begin to earn a modest profit from the shot after having made a commitment to sell it at cost during the pandemic.The company's chief executive officer, Pascal Soriot, however, reassured that low-income countries would continue to receive vaccines on a non-profit basis.","Covid-19 vaccine,AstraZenca vaccine"

world,world,India opens to tourists after 20 months,"Tour operators said, however, that demand was extremely sluggish due to high ticket prices and remaining restrictions on travelers from Britain, China and elsewhere.The country famous for the Taj Mahal, desert palaces and tiger reserves barred all foreign tourists in March 2020 as the pandemic intensified.But after a devastating spike in Covid-19 cases earlier this year, the number of known infections has fallen sharply and the government, under pressure from an industry that is an important pillar of the economy, last month announced a loosening.India's travel and tourism sector has been hit hard by the coronavirus pandemic.

world,world,"US retail sales surge as holiday shopping starts, brightening economic outlook","The solid report from the Commerce Department on Tuesday suggested high inflation was not yet dampening spending, even as worries about the rising cost of living sent consumer sentiment tumbling to a 10-year low in early November. Rising household wealth, thanks to a strong stock market and house prices, as well as massive savings and wage gains appear to be cushioning consumers against the highest annual inflation in three decades.Retail sales jumped 1.7 percent last month, the largest gain since March, after rising 0.8 percent in September. It was the third straight monthly advance and topped economists' expectations for a 1.4 percent increase. Sales soared 16.3 percent year-on-year in October and are 21.4 percent above their pre-pandemic level.""Today's numbers show that consumers are getting a jump on their holiday shopping,"" said Matthew Shay, president of the National Retail Federation in Washington. ""We continue to urge consumers to shop early and shop safely, and we fully expect this holiday season to be one for the record books.""October's broad increase in sales partly reflected higher prices as monthly consumer inflation surged 0.9 percent in October, which boosted the annual rate to 6.2 percent.Sales were led by motor vehicles, with receipts at auto dealerships advancing 1.8 percent after gaining 1.2 percent in September. The rise reflected the first increase in unit sales in six months, as well as higher prices. The tight supply of automobiles because of a global semiconductor shortage is driving up prices.But sales at clothing stores fell 0.7 percent. Sales at restaurants and bars were unchanged despite an ebb in Covid-19 infections, driven by the Delta variant. Restaurants and bars are the only services category in the retail sales report. These sales were up 29.3 percent from last October.""If services spending has largely recovered, strong goods demand increasingly looks to be a structural shift in consumer preferences, rather than a temporary Covid-related outcome,"" said Andrew Hollenhorst, chief U.S. economist at Citigroup in New York.Consumer spending, which accounts for more than two-thirds of U.S. economic activity rose at a tepid 1.7 percent rate last quarter. Economists at JPMorgan boosted their fourth-quarter GDP growth estimate to a 5 percent rate from a 4 percent pace. Goldman Sachs raised its estimate by 0.5 percentage point to a 5.0 percent rate. The economy grew at a 2 percent rate in the third quarter.The economic picture was further brightened by a separate report from the Federal Reserve on Tuesday showing manufacturing output surged 1.2 percent last month to its highest level since March 2019, after falling 0.7 percent in September.Businesses are also making steady progress replenishing depleted inventories, which should help to keep factories humming and support the economy.

Biden promised to address areas of concern, including human rights and other issues in the Indo-Pacific region.The U.S.-China bilateral relationship ""seems to me to have a profound impact not only in our countries, but quite frankly the rest of the world,"" Biden said.The talks, which were initiated by Biden and began shortly after 7:45 p.m. on Monday, were intended to make the relationship less acrimonious.The United States and China disagree on the origins of the Covid-19 pandemic, trade and competition rules, Beijing's expanding nuclear arsenal and its stepped-up pressure on Taiwan, among other issues.U.S. officials have downplayed expectations for any concrete agreements between both sides, including on trade, where China is lagging in a commitment to buy $200 billion more in U.S. goods and services. Not on Biden's agenda are U.S. tariffs on Chinese goods that Beijing and business groups hope to be scaled back.The White House has declined to answer questions on whether the United States will send officials to the Beijing Winter Olympics in February. Activists and U.S. lawmakers have urged the Biden administration to boycott the Games.""Both sides are trying to establish the call’s goal as creating stability in the relationship, both through their collegial language and overall framing of the conversation and the importance of the relationship,"" said Scott Kennedy, China expert at Washington's Center for Strategic and International Studies.""The question is whether they’ll reach agreement on anything, or at least, agree to disagree and avoid escalatory steps.""Xi, looking ahead to the Olympics and a Communist Party congress next year where he is expected to secure an unprecedented third term, is also keen to avoid heightened tensions with the United States.But he is expected to push back over Washington's efforts to carve out more space for Taiwan in the international system. China claims the self-ruled island as its own. Beijing has vowed to bring the island back under mainland control, by force if necessary.Foreign Ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian told a regular briefing on Monday: ""It is hoped that the United States and China will meet each other halfway, strengthen dialogue and cooperation, effectively manage differences, properly handle sensitive issues, and explore ways of mutual respect and peaceful coexistence.""Xi and Biden last week outlined competing visions, with Biden stressing the U.S. commitment to a ""free and open Indo-Pacific,"" which Washington says faces increasing Chinese ""coercion,"" while Xi warned against a return to Cold War tensions.A tabloid published by the ruling Communist Party's People's Daily on Monday called Taiwan ""the ultimate red line of China.""U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said last week that Washington and its allies would take unspecified ""action"" if China were to use force to alter the Taiwan status quo, further muddying the long-held U.S. policy of ""strategic ambiguity"" as to whether the United States would respond militarily.Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi warned Blinken in a call on Saturday against sending the wrong signals to Taiwan pro-independence forces.Taiwan is not the only flashpoint. Democrats in the U.S. Congress want Biden to make nuclear risk reduction measures with China a top priority, after the Pentagon reported that Beijing was significantly expanding its nuclear weapons and missile programs.Beijing argues its arsenal is dwarfed by those of the United States and Russia, and says it is ready for dialogue if Washington reduces its nuclear stockpile to China's level.""This is President Biden's opportunity to show steel, show strength on America's side, to make it clear that we are going to stand by our allies and that we will not endorse or condone the malign behavior that China has engaged in,"" said Republican Senator Bill Hagerty, who served as ambassador to Japan under former President Donald Trump.","US China,US China relations"

A survey of economists by  tipped a 3.0 percent expansion.However, the NBS cautioned in a statement that the ""international environment remains complex and severe"" with many uncertainties, adding that China needs to ""work harder to maintain economic stability and recovery"".""While electricity shortages and production cuts hampered output in early October, we don’t think they are a significant problem anymore,"" said Louis Kuijs of Oxford Economics on Monday.He added that this follows ""a range of policy measures to boost coal production and lower coal prices"".But economic momentum remained weak in October, he said, ""with the real estate downturn weighing on industry and a new wave of Covid outbreaks dampening household consumption"".Retail sales rose 4.9 percent on-year, according to latest data, up from September and far exceeding forecasts for 3.7 percent.But observers warn that this could be bogged down by recent containment measures, reimposed following a fresh virus outbreak in mid-October that has spread to several regions.The urban unemployment rate remained at 4.9 percent.Weakness in the economy is giving the country's central bank a headache as it must try to nurture a recovery while at the same time try to keep a lid on inflation, which is sitting at levels not seen since the mid-1990s.","China,economy,retail,employment"

world,world,UN climate summit reaches carbon markets deal,"The final deal adopted by nearly 200 countries will implement Article 6 of the 2015 Paris Agreement, allowing countries to partially meet their climate targets by buying offset credits representing emission cuts by others.Companies, as well as countries with vast forest cover, had pushed for a robust deal on government-led carbon markets in Glasgow, in the hope of also legitimizing the fast-growing global voluntary offset markets.Critics worry that offsetting could go too far in allowing countries to continue emitting climate-warming gases, making some wary of a hasty deal.The deal was ""a Brazilian victory"" and the country is gearing up to become a ""big exporter"" of carbon credits, its environment ministry said on social media. The country is home to much of the Amazon forest, and has huge potential to build wind and solar plants.""It should spur investment and the development of projects that could deliver significant emissions reductions,"" Brazil's chief negotiator Leonardo Cleaver de Athayde told .But nations most vulnerable to the effects of climate signaled concern over offsets possibly opening up for abuses allowing bad actors to avoid cutting emissions.""On Article 6, we will need to remain vigilant against greenwashing,"" the Marshall Islands' Climate Envoy Tina Stege said in a statement.Smoke billows from a chimney at a coking factory in Hefei, Anhui province, China, October 2, 2010. Photo by ReutersThe accord managed to overcome a series of sticking points that contributed to the failure of the previous two major climate meetings.Previously, there was disagreement over a tax on certain carbon trades intended to fund climate adaptation in poorer nations. The deal addressed this with a compromise that had a two-track approach.Bilateral trades of offsets between countries will not face the tax. The deal suggests developing nations capitulated to rich nations demands, including the United States, which had objected the levy.In a separate centralized system for issuing offsets, 5 percent of proceeds from offsets will be collected to go toward an adaptation fund for developing countries.Also in that system, 2 percent of the offset credits will be canceled. That aims to increase overall emissions cuts by stopping other countries using those credits as offsets to reach their climate targets.Another provision resolved how to carry forward carbon credits created under the old Kyoto Protocol, the Paris Agreement's predecessor, into the new offset market system.Negotiators reached a compromise that sets a cut-off date, with credits issued before that date not being carried forward.The final accord carries over any offsets registered since 2013. That will allow 320 million offsets, each representing a tonne of CO2, to enter the new market, according to an analysis by the NewClimate Institute and Oko-Institut non-profit organizations.Campaigners had warned against flooding the new market with old credits, and raised doubts about the climate benefits of some.The 2013 date ""is not good. So now it will be buyer countries' jobs to just say 'no' to them,"" said carbon markets expert Brad Schallert, with the World Wildlife Fund.One of the most contentious points had been on the question of whether credits could be claimed by both the country selling them and the country buying.A proposal by Japan resolved the issue and gained backing from both Brazil and the United States. Brazil's past insistence on allowing double counting had torpedoed an Article 6 deal in the past.Under the deal, the country that generates a credit will decide whether to authorize it for sale to other nations or to count towards their climate targets.If authorized and sold, the seller country will add an emission unit to its national tally and the buyer country will deduct one, to ensure the emissions cut is counted only once between countries.The same rules apply to credits used more broadly toward ""other international mitigation purposes"" - wording that some experts said could include a global scheme for offsetting aviation emissions, ensuring double counting does not happen there too.Matt Williams, a climate expert at the Energy and Climate Intelligence Unit, said the final deal was better but not perfect.""We've seen the worst possibilities for double counting of emissions cuts tightened up or guarded against. It doesn't mean it's ruled out completely.""","United Nations COP26,deal,Paris Agreement,climate change,carbon trades,wind,solar plants"
world,world,'Like prison': Singapore migrant workers suffer under Covid curbs,"More than 300,000 migrant workers, many of them from South Asia, live in dorms in the prosperous city-state, where they are typically packed into shared rooms and sleep on bunk beds.The vast complexes were hit by Covid-19 and locked down at the start of the pandemic, while restrictions were introduced across the whole country for a period to prevent a broader outbreak.Curbs have been eased for most in Singapore, where -- despite currently facing a renewed virus wave -- vaccinated people can go out shopping and to restaurants, and borders are gradually re-opening.But it is a different story for the low-paid migrants, who remain subject to far more onerous restrictions that mostly allow them to travel only between their work and accommodation.""It's a very painful life... like prison,"" said construction site worker Uddin, adding that before the pandemic he used to meet friends at the weekend to drink coffee, recite poetry and gossip.""We're only allowed to go to work and home, back and forth, and nowhere else. It's like living under house arrest,"" added the 43-year-old, who has worked in Singapore for 13 years and written two books about his experiences.Beyond heading to work, the migrants are allowed occasional trips to specially-built ""recreation centers"" that typically comprise shops set around a square, and sports facilities.Migrant workers wearing face masks as prevention for the spread of the COVID-19 coronavirus look out from a quarantined dormitory building in Singapore in May 20, 2020. Photo by AFPWhen the dormitories -- self-contained and usually in out-of-the-way parts of Singapore -- became the epicenter of the city's first Covid-19 wave last year, it sparked national soul-searching.Calls mounted to improve the livelihoods of migrants who have for decades done the back-breaking work of constructing the financial hub's gleaming skyscrapers, cleaning housing estates and maintaining public transport.The government pledged to take steps such as building new dormitories with more modern facilities and more space for residents.But the continued restrictions faced by the workers -- who typically earn from Sg$500 to $1,000 ($370 to $740) a month in one of the world's most expensive cities -- highlight how little has changed in reality, critics say.""Our government doesn't quite see them as fully human,"" Alex Au, vice-president of migrant rights group Transient Workers Count Too, told AFP.Authorities treat the migrants like ""an economic commodity"", and fail to ""accord them the same rights, the same freedoms that our citizens have,"" he said.As criticism mounted, authorities in the city-state of 5.5 million started a scheme that allows a limited number to make organized trips to designated areas.About 700 participated in the scheme's first month in September, and it was expanded at the end of last month to allow up to 3,000 workers a week from the dorms to participate.But this still represents only a tiny proportion of the workers.The government maintains that continued curbs on migrants -- who come from countries including Bangladesh, India and China -- are necessary as there is a higher risk of virus transmission due to their living conditions.This is despite the fact 98 percent of dorm residents have been fully vaccinated, higher than the city-state's overall rate of 85 percent.""Any easing of movement restrictions will need to be done in a careful and calibrated manner,"" Minister for Manpower Tan See Leng told parliament last week.He also said authorities have improved access to mental health services.But this is little comfort for dorm resident Amir from Bangladesh, who longs to have the freedom to go where he wants.""I miss nature, open space,"" said the 32-year-old construction site supervisor, who spoke using a pseudonym.""We can only see our dormitory life and our construction site. We cannot travel... cannot see outside.""For Uddin, change can't come soon enough for the increasingly stressed migrant workers.""We are facing psychological problems,"" he said, adding their ""fundamental rights as workers and human beings"" had been breached.""This imprisoned lifestyle won't let a person live a healthy life.""","Singapore,migrant workers,Covid curbs,Bangladesh,India,China,dormitory,stuck,Psychological problems"
world,world,Global stocks rise in week dominated by inflation fears,"Major US indices all gained, with the broad-based S&P 500 adding 0.7 percent, paring their losses for the week. But London’s FTSE bucked the bullish feeling, falling 0.5 percent.It was the second straight day of gains on Wall Street, amid a sense traders may have overreacted to the inflation data on Wednesday.""Inflation is running super-hot,"" said Neil Wilson, chief markets analyst at Markets.com, pointing to multi-decade highs of key gauges in the United States, Japan and China.Investors were spooked Wednesday following official US data showing annual consumer price inflation hit a 30-year high, which could force the Federal Reserve to hike interest rates more quickly to contain prices.A survey from the University of Michigan released Friday said US consumer sentiment fell to a 10-year low amid concerns that growing inflation is undermining purchasing power.But economists say sentiment should recover once global supply snarls are resolved, and consumers are unlikely to pull back on spending.The inflation trend is global, and data Friday showed German wholesale prices jumped 15.2 percent year-on-year in October, the strongest jump since March 1974 and an acceleration from the previous two months.""Yet investors don’t seem that bothered,"" Wilson said. ""Ultimately, the market remains fairly comfortable with fundamentals"" and with central banks keeping rates low, ""equities remain the only game in town.""While inflation headwinds are clearly spooking some, persistently low interest rates are leaving yield-hungry investors with few options other than to keep their faith in stocks — a scenario analysts dub TINA (there is no alternative).""Equities can’t continue to hold firm against this backdrop but in a TINA world, stranger things have happened,"" said Oanda analyst Craig Erlam, pointing to surging gold prices and the strengthening dollar.Those inflation safe havens rose again on Friday, with gold up 0.2 percent to $1,867.70 an ounce.""Investors turned to an old friend in time of need,"" Erlam said.Markets are looking to see if the global inflation spurt will ease as supply chain disruptions and wage hikes normalize, and businesses recover from their pandemic hit.","stock,ecocomy,stock market"
world,world,Governments seek solutions as Covid-19 case numbers rise in Europe,"WHAT IS THE SITUATION IN EUROPE?The weekly number of coronavirus cases across Europe has been on the rise since early October and now stands at levels unseen since the start of the pandemic.Over the past seven days 2,125,775 cases have been registered, a daily average of 303,682, according to an AFP tally based on official figures.That broke the previous European record of 1,988,507 cases logged in the week of November 2-8 2020.The latest figures also represent a 13-per cent rise on the previous week.Five countries - Britain, Germany, Russia, Turkey and Ukraine - logged rises of more than 50 per cent.It is worth noting that many more Covid tests are being carried out now than was the case when the pandemic first hit the continent in early 2020.ARE ALL PARTS OF EUROPE AFFECTED EQUALLY?The overall figures hide national differences which are due in large part to differences in the speed of the vaccination roll-out and the social health measures imposed.In Britain, for example, though Covid cases numbers are on the rise high vaccination rates have kept additional hospitalizations down, said Yves Coppieters, epidemiologist at the ULB university in Brussels.The same is not true of Eastern European countries, he added.In countries such as Spain and Portugal, which are very well vaccinated, or indeed Italy which has taken tough measures, the rebound is still not very visible, he added.France is somewhere in between, with a rise in cases ""but less strong"" Coppieters told AFP.On Friday, the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) said the situation was continuing to worsen in the EU.Of the 27 member states the centre placed Belgium, Poland, the Netherlands, Bulgaria, Croatia, the Czech Republic, Estonia, Greece, Hungary and Slovenia in the category of highest concern.HOW ARE COUNTRIES RESPONDING TO THE SURGE?For most European nations the main goal is to get as many people vaccinated as possible.France recently announced that the over-65s must receive a booster jab in order to obtain a health pass.Some are going further, starting to reinstate some of the restrictions on movement which populations had hoped were over.The Russian government said Friday it had submitted to parliament two bills that will introduce mandatory health passes to access restaurants and public transport, amid a new wave of coronavirus cases.Health professionals there will also have to wear masks and be tested for Covid twice a week.In Austria the government said it wants a nationwide lockdown for those not vaccinated against or recovered from the coronavirus.Only around 65 per cent of the population is fully vaccinated in Austria, a rate described by Chancellor Alexander Schallenberg as ""shamefully low"".Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte announced Western Europe's first partial lockdown of the winter, with at least three weeks of Covid curbs on restaurants, shops and sporting events.A side-effect of the tougher measures could be more public discontent.Several hundred protesters angered by Rutte's announcement gathered in The Hague afterwards, with police firing water cannon at them.WILL WE SEE THE DEATH RATE RISE?Last week the WHO's Europe chief warned that the current trajectory of Covid in Europe could mean ""another half a million Covid-19 deaths"" by February.A daily average of 4,031 coronavirus related deaths have been recorded over the past week - a 10-percent rise on the previous week and an 18-percent rise on the week before that.A year ago the daily average was 3,785 fatalities.""We are seeing a wave of infections due to the Delta variant and lower temperatures, but vaccination should prevent a correlation with hospitalizations,"" said Coppieters.""There will inevitably be great heterogeneity between countries depending on vaccination coverage.""WILL VACCINATING MORE PEOPLE BE ENOUGH?No, according to Coppieters.""The key is of course to vaccinate those most at risk to achieve herd immunity,"" he told ""For the rest of the population, we must above all maintain barrier measures, indoor ventilation and a testing policy,"" he added.Last week the WHO highlighted those methods, calling for continued vaccinations along with widespread use of masks and social distancing measures.","Covid-19,pandemic,lockdown,Europe"

It is also a production center for electronics firms such as Samsung(005930.KS).""Local authorities will cooperate with businesses and laborers to work out all necessary measures to ensure sufficient laborer supplies by the end of this year or early next year,"" Chinh said.Authorities will offer financial support for laborers' travel and accommodation and press ahead with vaccinations.Chinh said the government was seeking to restore supply chains and increase public investment to spur growth.""Public investment has not met target,"" Chinh said. ""The government has determined that speeding up public investment will be a key task to restore economic growth.""Earlier Friday, the investment minister said a raising of the public debt ceiling from the current level of 60% of gross domestic product was being considered to boost the economy, which contracted 6.17% in the third quarter.","labor,labor shortage,economy,Vietnam economy"

world,world,China ruling party leaders pass historic Xi resolution,"Xi, the uncontested leader of the world's most populous nation, has been heading a pivotal plenary of the ruling party's top figures since Monday in the Chinese capital.Some 400 members of the powerful Central Committee passed China's resolution on ""Major Achievements and Historical Experience of the Party's Centennial Struggle"" - only the third ever such resolution in its 100-year history.The previous two resolutions were issued under former leaders Mao Zedong in 1945, and Deng Xiaoping in 1981.The lengthy declaration called for upholding ""the correct view of party history"", said official news agency , adding that the party has ""written the most magnificent epic in the history of the Chinese nation for thousands of years.""""The Party Central Committee called on the entire party, the entire army and people of all ethnic groups to unite more closely around the Party Central Committee with Comrade Xi Jinping as the core, to fully implement Xi Jinping's new era of socialism with Chinese characteristics,"" the  readout read.This year's closed-door plenum paves the way for the 20th party congress next autumn, at which Xi is widely expected to be handed a third term in office, securing his position as China's most powerful leader since Mao.Analysts say the resolution will help Xi shore up his grip on power by setting in stone his vision for China and diminishing the role of previous leaders.The ""thought"" of Xi ""is the epitome of Chinese culture and soul,"" the text reads, saying that his presence at the ""heart"" of the ruling party ""is of decisive importance... to promote the historic process of the great renewal of the Chinese nation.""State TV's evening news broadcast said Xi's resolution was of ""wide-ranging historical significance"", showing footage of Xi addressing rows of delegates in the Great Hall of the People in front of red flags and the Communist symbol.The first such resolution on the party's history passed under Mao helped him cement his authority over the Communist Party four years before it seized power.The second, adopted under Deng, saw the regime adopt economic reforms and recognize the ""mistakes"" of Mao's ways.Unlike the 1981 resolution, Thursday's communique completely glosses over the widespread turmoil of the Cultural Revolution, a devastating period of political upheaval in the 1960s and 70s.Instead it refers to the period as one of ""socialist revolution and construction.""Chairman Mao is mentioned seven times in the document, while Deng only five times.In comparison, Xi Jingping is mentioned 17 times. this week described Xi as ""undoubtedly the core figure in charting the course of history.""","China,Chinese,Xi Jinping,resolution,politics"

world,world,"Biden, Xi to address Asia-Pacific leaders on trade, Covid recovery","China set the tone for the 21 member Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) meeting this week, with Xi warning in a video recording on Thursday that the region must not return to the tensions of the Cold War era.The comment was seen as a reference to efforts by the United States and its regional allies to blunt what they see as China's growing coercive economic and military influence.Biden is expected to address the gathering that begins midnight New Zealand time, the White House confirmed in a statement, adding he will discuss ongoing efforts to address the Covid-19 pandemic and support global economic recovery.""The President's participation demonstrates U.S. commitment to the Indo-Pacific region and to multilateral cooperation,"" the statement said.Chinese foreign ministry has also confirmed that Xi will speak at the meeting via video link.Xi will take the virtual podium a day after China's ruling Communist Party approved a rare resolution that amplified his status and authority, bolstering the likelihood of securing an unprecedented third leadership term next year.The APEC gathering comes ahead of a much-anticipated online summit between Biden and Xi on Monday, as the super powers look to prevent growing tensions between the world's two biggest economies from spiralling toward conflict.APEC is the last multi-lateral meeting of the year and comes after a flurry of gatherings including the high-profile G20 summit in Rome and the COP26 climate meeting in Glasgow, Scotland.APEC in 2021 was hosted entirely online due to host New Zealand's hardline pandemic control measures and saw political and business leaders emphasize the need to fight Covid-19, decarbonise economies and grow sustainably.During a session on Friday, German chancellor Angela Merkel reiterated the importance of vaccinations in the fight against the pandemic. New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern then paid tribute to the outgoing chancellor.The APEC summit will be held in Thailand next year.The United States has offered to host the 2023 round of APEC meetings for the first time in over a decade, although a consensus has not been reached on this proposal, officials have said.Russia's President Vladimir Putin and Canadian President Justin Trudeau are also expected to speak at the meeting.","Joe Biden,Xi Jinping,US,China,recovery,Covid-19,Asia Pacific"

Photo by ReutersThe U.S. Trade Representative's office would review Cambodia's trade benefits under the Generalized System of Preferences for developing countries once Congress reauthorized that program, which expired in 2020, he added.Earlier on Wednesday, the Treasury slapped sanctions on Cambodia's navy commander, Tea Vinh, and on Chau Phirun, the director-general of the Defense Ministry's Material and Technical Services Department, accusing the two of planning to share funds skimmed from the Ream naval base project.The base in the Gulf of Thailand has drawn concern from Washington over China's growing military presence there.The sanctions freeze their U.S. assets and generally bar Americans from dealing with them. The U.S. State Department on Wednesday also barred the officials and several of their family members from traveling to the U.S.""The United States will not stand by while corrupt officials personally benefit at the expense of the Cambodian people,"" Andrea Gacki, director of the Treasury's Office of Foreign Assets Control, said in the statement.Cambodia's foreign and defense ministries did not immediately respond to a request for comment.A year ago, Cambodia said it had razed a U.S.-funded facility at the Ream naval base to allow for further expansion. The United States said Cambodia had a year earlier turned down its offer to repair the base.The United States last month accused Cambodia of lacking transparency about Chinese construction activities at the base, and urged the government to disclose to its people the full scope of Beijing's military involvement.The Treasury and State Department statements on Wednesday did not mention China's involvement with the base.Cambodia has moved closer to China to become one of its most important allies in Southeast Asia, at a time when Washington is seeking to counter Beijing's growing influence in the region.","US,Cambodia,sanction,officials,navy base corruption advisory"
world,world,China's Xi warns against return to Cold War tensions at APEC meeting,"Xi, in a recorded video message to a CEO forum on the sidelines of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) summit hosted by New Zealand, said attempts to draw ideological lines or form small circles on geopolitical grounds were bound to fail.""The Asia-Pacific region cannot and should not relapse into the confrontation and division of the Cold War era,"" Xi said.Xi's remarks were an apparent reference to U.S. efforts with regional allies and partners including the Quad grouping with India, Japan and Australia, to blunt what they see as China's growing coercive economic and military influence.China's military said on Tuesday it conducted a combat readiness patrol in the direction of the Taiwan Strait, after its Defense Ministry condemned a visit by a U.S. congressional delegation to Taiwan, the democratically governed island claimed by Beijing.Combative U.S. diplomatic exchanges with China early in the Biden administration unnerved allies, and U.S. officials believe direct engagement with Xi is the best way to prevent the relationship between the world's two biggest economies from spiraling toward conflict.A date has not been announced for the Xi-Biden meeting, but a person briefed on the matter said it was expected to be as soon as next week.The week-long annual forum, culminating in a meeting of leaders from all 21 APEC economies on Friday, is being conducted entirely online by hosts New Zealand, a country with hardline pandemic control measures that has kept its borders closed to almost all travelers for 18 months.Xi has only appeared by video, and has not left China in about 21 months as the country pursues a zero-tolerance policy towards Covid-19. The Chinese president is also participating this week in a meeting of the ruling Communist Party that is expected to further cement his authority.Xi said emerging from the shadow of the pandemic and achieving steady economic recovery was the most pressing task for the region, and that countries must close the Covid-19 immunization gap.""We should translate the consensus that vaccines are a global public good into concrete actions to ensure their fair and equitable distribution,"" Xi said.APEC members pledged at a special meeting in June to expand sharing and manufacturing of Covid-19 vaccines and lift trade barriers for medicines.Taiwan's bid to join a regional trade pact, the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership (CPTPP), is expected raise tensions at the APEC leaders' meeting later in the week.China, which has also applied to join CPTPP, opposes Taiwan's membership and has increased military activities near the island which Beijing claims. The United States pulled out of CPTPP under former President Donald Trump.A 15-nation regional trade pact backed by China, the Regional Comprehensive Partnership Agreement (RCEP), will also take effect from Jan. 1.Xi said in the lead-up to RCEP implementation and CPTPP negotiations that China would ""shorten the negative list on foreign investment, promote all-round opening up of its agricultural and manufacturing sectors, expand the opening of the service sector and treat domestic and foreign businesses as equals in accordance with law.""The United States has offered to host APEC in 2023 for the first time in over a decade as President Joe Biden turns resources and attention to the Asia-Pacific following the withdrawal of U.S. forces from Afghanistan.However, no consensus has yet been reached among APEC members on the offer.Climate change has been a key item on the agenda at the summit, which is taking place in parallel with the United Nations' COP26 meeting in Glasgow.Xi said China would achieve its carbon neutrality targets within the time frame it has set and its carbon reduction action would require massive investment.New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern said in her opening address that APEC had taken steps to wean the region's industries off fossil-fuel subsidies.","China,APEC,Cold War,diplomacy,politics"
world,world,China's factory inflation hits 26-year high as power crunch bites,"The producer price index (PPI) climbed 13.5 percent from a year earlier, faster than the 10.7 percent rise in September, the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) said in a statement.It matched a pace not seen since July 1995 and was faster than the 12.4 percent forecast by analysts in a Reuters poll.Consumer price rises also quickened, although at a slower pace than factory gate prices. The consumer price index (CPI) rose 1.5 percent in October year-on-year, compared with September's 0.7 percent rise.The mounting price pressures complicate deliberations for the People's Bank of China, which may now be wary of injecting monetary stimulus too quickly amid concerns about fanning inflation, even as growth in the world's second-largest economy slows.""We are concerned about the pass-through from producer prices to consumer prices,"" said Zhiwei Zhang, chief economist at Pinpoint Asset Management, in a note.Consumer prices will likely speed up in coming months as firms faced depleted inventories and are forced to pass higher costs onto customers, he added.""The risk of stagflation continues to rise.""Slowing economic growth and soaring factory inflation have fuelled concerns over stagflation, which could mean China has to move cautiously on loosening monetary policy.""Rising CPI inflation and elevated PPI inflation reduces the probability of a PBoC policy rate cut,"" said Ting Lu, Chief China Economist at Nomura.Upstream industries drove factory gate price rises, with coal mining and washing prices surging 103.7 percent from a year earlier and prices in the oil and gas extraction industry rising 59.7 percent.""Factory gate inflation is probably close to a peak,"" said Julian Evans-Pritchard, senior China economist at Capital Economics, in a note, citing coal price falls.Several Chinese food giants have announced increases in retail prices in recent weeks, as rising production costs erode profit margins. Foshan Haitian Flavouring And Food, vinegar producer giant Jiangsu Hengshun and frozen food firm Fujian Anjoy Foods have all hike prices.The PPI inched up 2.5 percent on a monthly basis, compared with the 1.2 percent uptick in September.Core inflation, which strips out volatile food and energy prices, stood at 1.3 percent rise in October from the previous year, higher than the 1.2 percent uptick in September.","China,power crunch"

""So the first deliveries, assuming the Indian government grants export authorization, won't happen until a few weeks from now.""SII, the health ministry and the WHO did not immediately respond to requests for comment.The ministry said in a statement earlier in the day that Indian states had more than 159 million unutilized doses of various vaccines, as inoculations have slowed after 79 percent of the country's 944 million adults got one dose and 37 percent got two doses.SII CEO Adar Poonawalla told Reuters last month that the company could send 20 million to 30 million doses a month to Covax in November and December, which would increase to ""large volumes"" from January once India's own needs were met.WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said on Friday that Covax had the money and the contracts to buy vaccines for low-income countries but ""manufacturers have not played their part"".Covax in September cut its 2021 delivery target by nearly 30 percent to 1.425 billion doses.","Covid-19 vaccine,Covax,India vaccine"

Plans could be finalized during a G7 meeting in December, the official said.A U.S. delegation visited Ecuador, Panama and Colombia during a similar tour in early October, with another slated to visit Asia before year-end, the official said, without naming any specific Asian countries.The G7 B3W initiative is aimed at narrowing the $40 trillion in infrastructure investment that developing countries will need by 2035 and providing an alternative to problematic lending practices by China, officials have said.The United States will offer developing countries ""the full range"" of U.S. financial tools, including equity stakes, loan guarantees, political insurance, grants and technical expertise to focus on climate, health, digital technology and gender equality, the official told reporters.The effort is seeking to ""identify flagship projects that could launch by the start of next year,"" the official said.Singh was joined in Africa by Alexia Latortue, deputy chief executive officer of the Millennium Challenge Corp, and Travis Adkins, deputy assistant administrator for Africa at the U.S. International Development Finance Corp, said Emily Horne, spokesperson for the White House National Security Council.Biden sought to advance the initiative during a meeting on the sidelines of the COP26 UN climate conference with European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, British Prime Minister Boris Johnson and other G7 partners, she added.The administration official said senior officials in Senegal and Ghana welcomed U.S. assurances that unlike China, the world's largest creditor, the United States would not require non-disclosure agreements or collateral agreements that could result in later seizure of ports or airports.Projects discussed included setting up a possible vaccine manufacturing hub for West Africa in Senegal, bolstering renewable energy supplies, boosting lending to women-owned businesses, and narrowing the digital divide.","China,China Belt and Road,US China"
world,world,Asian markets mixed as inflation plays against recovery optimism,"Tourism-linked firms rallied on optimism about the global reopening after Pfizer said its pill to treat Covid was highly effective.Wall Street's three main indexes clocked up records last week after figures showed more than half a million new U.S. jobs were created last month, with hiring rebounding as new infections fall across the country. Figures for the previous two months were also revised up.The news provided fresh evidence that the world's top economy is well on the recovery track as life slowly returns to some semblance of normal.But optimism continues to be held back by worries about inflation, which has surged this year owing to a pick-up in demand, a spike in energy prices and supply chain snarls -- forcing central banks around the world to start rowing back their massive pandemic-era support measures.""Inflation is the major headwind right now,"" Dana D'Auria, at Envestnet, told Bloomberg Television.Adding to inflation expectations is Joe Biden's $1.2 trillion infrastructure bill that finally passed through Congress on Friday, giving the president a much-needed boost in his plan to push through vast spending measures to support the economy.However, another proposal to stump up another $1.9 trillion for social and environmental programs continues to languish.The US jobs report was followed Sunday by China saying exports had soared by a better-than-expected 27.1 percent in October as factories kept goods flowing out despite power outages in recent months caused by emission reduction targets, the surging price of coal and supply problems.Traders are keeping an eye on Beijing as the Communist Party holds a pivotal meeting this week that is likely to see leader Xi Jinping shore up his grip on power as he looks to tighten the government's control of the economy.Xi's ""common prosperity"" drive to redistribute wealth has seen authorities clamp down on a range of industries -- particularly tech firms -- that has rattled markets in recent months.Companies focused on tourism surged after Pfizer said Friday that a clinical trial of its pill to treat Covid-19 had shown it was 89 percent effective, adding that it was a huge step towards emerging from the pandemic. Pfizer's is the second anti-Covid pill after that of Merck.Meanwhile, Pfizer board member and a former head of the Food and Drug Administration Scott Gottlieb told CNBC's Squawk Box that the pandemic could be over in the United States by January.The news on the treatment ramped up hopes that more countries would be able to reopen to foreign travelers soon, sending airlines soaring.China Airlines and Air China piled on more than 10 percent apiece, while Japan Airlines and Hong Kong's Cathay Pacific rose around five percent.Macau-based casinos also enjoyed strong buying with Sands China rocketing nine percent, with MGM China and Galaxy Entertainment more than six percent up.Oil extended Friday's rally after OPEC and other major producers refused to heed Biden's calls last week to ramp up output to meet a surge in demand, while US officials are considering releasing some of the country's strategic supplies to temper petrol prices.","Asian market,inflation,U.S.,China,Wall Street"

world,world,Chinese exports solid in October as Covid eases overseas,"The data from the world's second-largest economy also suggested that Chinese factories had kept the goods flowing out despite power outages in recent months caused by emission reduction targets, the surging price of coal, and supply shortages.The government said last week that the power crisis was winding down thanks to a boost in domestic coal output.Exports rose a better-than-expected 27.1 percent on-year in October, according to customs authorities, to $300.2 billion.Imports came in slightly below analyst estimates, rising 20.6 percent in October.In recent months, several Chinese factories were forced to halt operations due to power outages, raising concerns about global supply chains.The squeeze had worsened as China's Covid-19 border restrictions hindered shipments of raw materials from overseas while a trade tiff with Australia exacerbated the drop in coal imports.","China,China exports,Covid-19 restrictions"

In the evening, the friend returned with a mere VND2,000.""I was shocked; I spent an entire afternoon only to get VND2,000. If only the commune told me about the amount of money beforehand so I could decide whether to go or not,"" she said, adding the cash was not even enough to cover the fuel cost.Huynh Thi Thu Van, deputy chairwoman of Tam Vinh Commune, said around 10 square meters of Truyen's banana plantation suffered 70 percent damage. With every hectare of damaged equal to VND4 million in support, Truyen should have received VND4,000. But due to the commune's current policies on providing near half the support money, the amount was reduced to VND2,000, Van said.She added that following the impacts of two storms in 2020, around 588 families had seen their crops damaged, receiving over VND1 billion in support.

news,news,'Absurd' quarantine policies irk Hanoians,"Nguyen Hoang Phuong, who lives in the Royal City urban complex in Thanh Xuan District, was designated a close contact of a Covid-19 case on November 5 after being in the same elevator.He was notified on November 11 to enter a centralized quarantine camp, which meant he would have to spend 14 days in the camp after having self-isolated himself for seven days.""It's absurd... a waste of time and not at all necessary,"" said Phuong, adding that he was puzzled after learning that several others who shared the same elevator did not have to go into centralized quarantine as he did.Phuong, who has received two Covid-19 vaccine shots, said there was only a low chance of him getting infected as he spent less than a minute inside the elevator and he had worn a mask. But all his requests to allow self-isolation in his apartment or other quarantine facilities with paid services were denied.""I understand the importance of disease prevention, but I'm also worried about the risk of cross-infection in quarantine zones,"" he said.Minister of Health Nguyen Thanh Long had said on November 11 that people who have already received two Covid-19 vaccine shots, follow coronavirus prevention measures and whose living quarters satisfy safety criteria would not have to enter 14-day centralized quarantine, even if they were in the same elevator with a coronavirus case.""Then why do I have to?"" Phuong asked.On November 19, Hanoi issued guidelines on allowing close contacts of Covid-19 cases in 26 districts to be isolated at home. Four downtown districts – Ba Dinh, Hoan Kiem, Dong Da and Hai Ba Trung, however, would still apply centralized quarantine measures due to their ""special importance."" Some districts, like Hoang Mai, apply centralized quarantine and home quarantine at the same time.Nguyen Viet Hung, deputy chairman of the Hanoi Infection Control Society, said the exclusion of four Hanoi districts from home quarantine measures was ""confusing and represented inequality in the coronavirus fight."" He suggested that all mild Covid-19 cases and close contacts be allowed home quarantine.""Forcing people to enter centralized quarantine may lead to people lying to avoid it,"" he said.Phuong is not an isolated case. Tran Trang, 31, of Dong Da District said she'd come into contact with a Covid-19 case on November 12, but it was not until November 16 that local authorities took her into centralized quarantine at the dorm of FPT University.""There are places that start counting your quarantine days from the point of making contact with Covid-19 cases, but there are also places that don't. I don't know when I'll get out,"" she said, adding that she has a small child at home and her house was ""more than enough"" for her to self-isolate.Ha Dong District resident Doan Thanh, 31, was notified four days after going into centralized quarantine that he would be able to self-isolate at home if he tested negative for the virus after completing seven days in centralized quarantine. His initial happiness on hearing this evaporated as he faced bureaucratic hurdles ahead.He would need to file a form and send to his ward's Steering Committee for Covid-19 Prevention and Control. An inspection team would come to his house to evaluate whether it satisfied criteria for self-isolation. If it did, the team would send another form to the committee so an approval paper would be issued.""Way too complicated,"" Thanh exclaimed. He tried to sign up, but has received neither a certificate to confirm he's been in centralized quarantine, nor an appropriate form to send to the committee. When he called the ward to ask, they said to refer the matter to a medical center. No one at the centralized quarantine facility answered his inquiries.""I might have already finished my centralized quarantine period before I get my hands on that paper,"" said a frustrated Thanh.Nguyen Truong Sinh, chairman of Xuan Phuong Ward in Nam Tu Liem District, said all close contacts who wish to leave centralized quarantine facilities and go home for self-isolation must get approval from the concerned facilities. He said all procedures are being followed appropriately.""But no one told me how one's supposed to follow those procedures,"" Thanh said.Those who are allowed to self-isolate at home face different hurdles.Nguyen Tra My, 29, had already packed her stuff to go into centralized quarantine after coming into contact with a Covid-19 case on November 10. On November 15, she was notified that she should self-isolate at home as the centralized quarantine zone was overloaded. So she locked herself in her own room in Cau Giay District.But My has had to venture outside twice, traveling four kilometers from Mai Dich to Trung Hoa District to be tested for the coronavirus. She requested that someone comes to her house to take her samples, or at least allow the collection to take place at a closer location, but her request was denied.""Making people travel four kilometers is not quarantining,"" she said.Nguyen Hai Yen, deputy director of the Cau Giay District medical center, agreed that those who came into close contact with Covid-19 cases should not be asked to go out to get tested. She added that the district detects around 8-12 new clusters every day, and the number of close contacts has spiraled out of control.According to the Hanoi People’s Committee, the capital has recorded over 8,600 close contacts of Covid-19 cases between November 11 and November 17. Of these over 1,100 have eventually become infected with the novel coronavirus. That means that around  eventually became coronavirus cases, twice the rate recorded between October 11 and October 31.Phuong said he was less than impressed about existing Covid-19 policies in Hanoi.On learning that an entire floor of an apartment building was locked down for two weeks just because one family had a coronavirus case, he fumed: ""If one is fully vaccinated and there are multiple ways to prevent infection, why should there be measures that trouble people to no end?""","Vietnam,Vietnamese,Hanoi,Covid-19,coronavirus,Covid,quarantine"

They pointed to plans to track pledges, as well as the promises of cash and innovative technologies, such as high-yielding, drought-resistant crops.Britain said 28 nations that are big consumers of deforestation-linked commodities such as beef, soy, palm oil and cocoa had joined a Forest, Agriculture and Commodity Trade (FACT) roadmap launched in February this year.FACT says it promotes sustainable land use as a step to unlock investments, create jobs and protect forest livelihoods.""The next challenge is to go from bold statements to real implementation,"" said Yadvinder Malhi, a professor of ecosystem science at the University of Oxford.Britain grabbed headlines this week by announcing a range of new alliances, such as one by more than 40 nations to phase out coal and another by major investors with $130 trillion at their disposal to boost the green economy.""Important as these announcements may be, they are not legally binding,"" noted Mohamed Adow, director of Power Shift Africa, a Kenya-based climate and energy think-tank.","COP26,nature,climate,globlal warming"

On a year-on-year basis, the index was up 31.3 percent in October.Agricultural commodity prices have risen steeply in the past year, driven by harvest setbacks and strong demand.The FAO's cereal price index rose by 3.2 percent in October from the previous month. That was led by a 5 percent jump in wheat prices, which climbed for a fifth consecutive month to reach their highest since November 2012, FAO said.""Tighter availability in global markets due to reduced harvests in major exporters, especially Canada, the Russian Federation and the United States of America, continued to put upward pressure on prices,"" FAO said of wheat.Wheat futures started November at new peaks, with U.S. prices at fresh highs since 2012 and Paris front-month futures at a record high as import demand remained brisk.World vegetable oil prices jumped 9.6 percent on the month to set a record high, supported by further strength in palm oil prices as labour shortages in Malaysia continued to hamper production, FAO said.In contrast, global sugar prices eased 1.8 percent in October, ending a run of six straight monthly rises, according to FAO.Rome-based FAO cut its projection of global cereal production in 2021, to 2.793 billion tonnes from 2.800 billion estimated a month ago, according to its cereal supply and demand outlook.That mainly reflected reduced wheat output estimates for Iran, Turkey and the United States, offsetting an increased forecast for coarse grain production.Expected world cereal output would still represent a record, but would trail projected demand, leading to a fall in forecast cereal stocks, FAO said.Demand was supported by a raised projection of global cereal trade to a new record, bolstered by increased wheat trade.","rice,FAO,food,food prices"

world,world,Asia tourism reopens with big-spending Chinese stuck at home,"China, previously the world's largest outbound tourism market, is keeping international air capacity at just 2 percent of pre-pandemic levels and has yet to relax tight travel restrictions as it sticks to zero tolerance for Covid-19.That has left a $255 billion annual spending hole in the global tourism market for operators such as Thailand's Laguna Phuket to try and fill.Managing director Ravi Chandran says Laguna Phuket's five resorts have shifted their marketing focus to Europe, the United States and United Arab Emirates to make up for the loss of Chinese visitors, who accounted for 25-30 percent of its pre-Covid business.""Up to today, we have not done significant marketing or promotion in China ... because we don't feel anything coming our way,"" Chandran said.Vendors and tourists at a beach in Phuket, Thailand, August 2021. Photo by AFThe pandemic has cost Thailand an estimated $50 billion a year in tourism revenue and Chinese were above-average spenders based on tourism ministry data.Thailand hopes to receive 180,000 foreign tourists this year, a fraction of around 40 million it received in 2019, as it opened places beyond Phuket to tourists on Monday.Many experts expect China to keep such stringent measures such as up to a three-week quarantine for those returning home until at least the second quarter of next year and possibly then open gradually on a country-by-country basis.""Destinations have to identify new source markets and learn how to market and cater to different cultures,"" Pacific Asia Travel Association (PATA) Chief Executive Liz Ortiguera said, citing the Maldives as a rare example of a successful pivot during the pandemic.The string of islands in the Indian Ocean promoted itself heavily at trade shows and attracted more Russian and Indian visitors to its luxury resorts and sparkling waters.China had been its greatest source of tourists before the pandemic but the Maldives saw overall arrivals in the first nine months of 2021 fall just 12 percent versus the same period of 2019.""When we realized that Chinese travelers weren't coming to the Maldives any time soon, we switched our focus to other key markets including Russia,"" said a spokesperson for COMO Hotels and Resorts, which has two Maldives resorts.Travel data firm ForwardKeys estimates it will take until 2025 for Chinese outbound travel to recover to pre-pandemic levels. That will also force airlines to re-evaluate their routes given its data shows 38% of Chinese tourists took foreign carriers in 2019.Even as Singapore, Thailand and Indonesia's Bali gradually open up for international travelers, Thai Airways and Garuda Indonesia are drastically shrinking their fleets as part of restructuring plans amid the absence of Chinese tourists.When China does open its borders, industry surveys show a reluctance by many to travel internationally due to Covid-19 fears.There has also been a boom in domestic holidays to Hainan Island which now offers duty free shopping in a threat to future visits to nearby destinations such as Hong Kong and South Korea.""I honestly do not have much enthusiasm for international travel,"" said at Kat Qi, 29, a researcher in Beijing who traveled to Southeast Asia and Britain before the pandemic. ""A lot of places that I wanted to visit are in less developed countries with gorgeous natural scenery and they tend to be the least vaccinated countries.""Her preference for natural scenery is also a trend emerging in surveys of Chinese travelers. Many are focused on the outdoors at a time when domestic camping holidays have become popular and tourism operators will need to adapt accordingly, experts say.""The market will have changed so the Chinese people traveling in 2022 will be different from the Chinese traveling in 2019,"" said Wolfgang Georg Arlt, CEO of the China Outbound Tourism Research Institute. ""I think the trends will go away from this shopping and rushing around.""Large group tours that have also fallen out of favor on domestic trips could also be a thing of the past, to be replaced by independent travel and smaller customized tours with family and friends, said Sienna Parulis-Cook, director of marketing and communications at advisory firm Dragon Tail International.""You might have organized travel and everything but it would be with a small group of people that you know, rather than 50 strangers on a tour bus,"" she said.","Asia,tourism,China tourist,travel restrictions,Covid,Thailand,Singapore,Indonesia"
news,news,,"With childhoods tainted by the smell of opium and the absence of parents who are often in prison, dropping out of school is usually the
norm.One early morning in June 2019 Ly Xe Me tied her hair, picked up a basket and stepped out of her thatched, rammed-earth house atop the highest
spot in the mountainous Ta Ko Ki Village.Her youngest son rubbed his eyes and ran after her, asking where she was going. ""Mummy is going to the other side to the market, and will be
back in a bit.""The Ha Nhi woman's trip to the market, it turned out, lasted nearly two years.She took the VND2 million ($88) left in the house and walked a whole day through the forest to go and buy opium in Laos.But the moment she stepped back into Vietnam, she was caught by border guards.Her husband had been addicted to opium for decades. Ever since he was diagnosed with liver cancer, the drug also helped alleviate his pain in
addition to satisfying his craving.Their three children could eat nothing but rice for 10 days, but he could not go a single day without opium. The ""market trips"" had therefore
become as routine to her as working in the field.Me was sentenced to 20 months in prison for the possession of 143 grams of opium. Her trial, like many similar trials held at the Muong Nhe
District Court, included an interpreter as she could not speak Vietnamese.In 2019 Dien Bien Province recorded an average of one drug-related arrest every 15 hours, mostly of ethnic minority people.A report that year by the Committee for Ethnic Minority Affairs said the province's proportion of ethnic minority people addicted to drugs was
five times the national average.Of the nearly 10,000 drug addicts in the province, 41 percent were Thai and 29 percent were Hmong.The provinces with the highest addiction rates such as Dien Bien, Cao Bang, Son La, and Lai Chau were also among the poorest provinces, and
all are along the northern border.In Muong Nhe, the poorest district in the poorest province in the country, Dien Bien, six out of 10 households lived in poverty.In addition to sending Me to prison, opium also took her children out of their one safe place: school.Two days after Me had left, there was still no one to cook for Vu Go Tru.There was no rice in the kitchen, and the only food left was half an old gourd left over from the previous meal. Both of his older siblings
were in the field, and his 60-year-old father was lying in his room, suffering from pain and craving opium.""Is mom coming home soon, Dad?""""Don't know.""After three such conversations, the nine-year-old boy ran to a neighbor's house with a bowl and managed to get some rice. He put the bowl of
rice by his father's bed, grabbed his backpack and left for school.Like most boarding schools for ethnic minorities, Sin Thau Elementary School keeps its students from quitting by providing them with meals
that include more than just rice.Students sleep and eat all three meals at school from Monday to Friday afternoon and go home for the weekend.When returning to school on Sunday, children from well-off families are driven to school by their parents on motorbikes with some vegetables
and firewood to contribute to the school's kitchen.Tru on the other hand often went to school empty-handed. Even with his mother around, every meal at home consisted of rice mixed with Ha Nhi
tea. The money from selling chickens and vegetables and tending forests all went to buy opium for his father.Tru tried for a few more weeks to find his mother. He did not dare to ask his father more questions. Over the years he had come to realize
that whenever his father craved drugs it was not prudent to go close to him if he did not want to be yelled at and insulted.The 13 thatched houses of Ta Ko Ki village are scattered among the tree marigold sprouting from the muddy dirt roads. All their inhabitants
are Ha Nhi people and related to each other, with their family names being either Vu or Ly. But none of them knew Me's whereabouts or knew but
would not tell Tru.""Do you know where mom is?"" Tru kept asking his older brother one evening. In response, the ninth grader turned around, faced the wall and
said tersely: ""Dad told me to quit school and work in the field. Tomorrow you just go to school, there’s no need to wait.""Without his mother Tru was no longer looking forward to coming home on Friday afternoon like before.The day before Me left, she had taken off her head scarf and hung it on a clothes line outside the kitchen. Every time he came home, Tru would
stop and look at it, hoping the scarf was no longer there, which would mean his mother had finally returned.Over time he gradually got used to the idea that his mother will never return and his brother will be constantly absent. Ever since his
brother moved to live in the field and his sister got married, the only family he had was his father.On the earthen wall of the middle room in their house still hung two certificates of merit awarded to village chief Vu Vu Sinh for his
achievements in preventing forest fires. But that was a story of five years ago. Ever since his wife's arrest Sinh had no opium to smoke and so
mostly stayed in bed, struggled with his drug craving and ate whatever food his relatives gave him.In the evening on November 16 last year Tru's brother suddenly arrived in front of the Sin Thau Middle School gates to fetch him home.Everyone in Ta Ko Ki Village had already gathered at their house. Sinh only had time to reach out and touch his youngest child's face one last
time before breathing his last.After losing both parents in the span of less than two years, in addition to his sadness, Tru also had a vague fear now: When his mother left
his brother had to drop out of school; now that his father had died would he be able to continue going to school?Twelve years ago Chang A Minh moved with his parents from Tua Chua District to Muong Nhe.Mr Chia, his father, let his wife and children carry their clothes but insisted on carrying his opium pipe in his own hands as if it was an
heirloom.
After two days of traveling by boat up the Da River, the first thing Mr Chia did upon arriving in Chung Chai Commune in Muong Nhe District was to
run to a relative's place, pull out his opium lamp and smoke.In the late 1980s Tua Chua, where Mr Chia hails from, was still famous throughout the northwest as a poppy hotspot with thousands of hectares
under the crop and an output of tens of tons of opium. The golden age may be long gone, but even this year several of Mr. Chia's compatriots were
arrested for planting poppy in their gardens or for smuggling it out to sell.Mr Chia is 40 years old but looks like an old man. He does not remember when he became addicted, only that opium had been part of his
grandfather's life and father's life. Now it is even affecting the lives of his eight children.Of the few images Minh still remembers from his childhood, the most profound is the image of his father lying next to an opium lamp.Minh's former teacher once went all the way to Mr Chia's opium mat to convince him to stop smoking the drug and take care of his children. In
response, he just bowed his head and replied, ""Only death will end my addiction.""In all these years Minh's mother has never dared advise her husband. She quietly drags the children out, goes to the field alone, harvests
bamboo shoots, cooks wine, repairs the house, and takes care of the children all by herself.During his school days, every time Minh went back to his boarding school, Mrs Chia would harvest some vegetables from the garden, sell them in
a faraway market and give him VND5,000-10,000, all without letting her husband know.Like in Tru's family, opium takes priority in this household too. Minh completed fifth grade and then voluntarily dropped out of school to
stay home and help his mother take care of his five younger siblings.A 2017 report by the United Nations Development Program and the Committee for Ethnic Minority Affairs said after surveying 39 ethnic groups
that only about 60 percent of adults could read and write Vietnamese.The Hmong were among the groups with the highest illiteracy rate in the country as well as the largest difference between men and women's
illiteracy rates.Minh's eldest sister became 26 this year, but she has never been to school. When she sees strangers, she would hide herself since she cannot
speak Vietnamese, and can only respond by smiling or shaking her head.While living in Tua Chua, she once opened her younger brother's book to take a peek out of curiosity, but was caught by her father and beaten
till her arms were bruised, all without understanding why.Her husband is a young man from the same village who was already addicted to drugs before marrying her. He is almost always high either on
drugs or liquor.But her two younger sisters proved they wanted to live differently from their mother and older sister, and escape drug-addicted men.In 2015 Chang Thi Dang, then 17, ran away from home. ""At home it is too harsh, I can't stand it,"" she told a neighbor and friend before
leaving, also leaving a message her family should not look for her.Three years later Mr Chia's third daughter also ran away from home at the age of 15.The chief of Tan Phong village was reluctant to reveal the number of drug addicts living in his jurisdiction, but could not hide his concern
for girls who are without a home at an age when they should be playing and going to school.Many girls in his village have run away from home due to lack of food, being scolded by their fathers or quarreling with their boyfriends.No one knows how things are with them until they themselves contact their families again. But there are also many girls who are never heard of
again.Dang's first phone call to her parents was three years later, when she informed them she had married a merchant in China, had just given birth
to a son and had a reasonably good life. In spring two years ago, on his elder sister's instructions, Minh crossed the A Pa Chai Border Gate and
waited to be picked up by a man wearing a blue jacket made of parachute fabric on a black motorbike. That was his brother-in-law.After three days of sightseeing, Minh got CNY500 ($78 now) from his sister, who told him to tell their parents she would visit them once her
children are old enough.In recent years Mr Chia has moved to permanently live on the field. In addition to opium, he now has a newfound interest -- the yuan-dong
exchange rate -- and looks forward to the first day of every month to see if his daughter has sent him any money.How old the rest of his children are, what grades they are in, or even whether they still go to school ... he has no idea.With its large area and plenty of land, Muong Nhe District attracted tens of thousands of Hmong people such as Mr Chia's family from
neighboring areas, who made it their new home.After the uncontrolled mass migrations of the past decade, the already poor district now also has to put up with large numbers of drug
addicts.A cycle of deforestation and uncontrolled establishment of new villages has also been going on for years.In 2020 district authorities discovered an average of four deforestation cases per month and arrested the accused.Besides, the district leader admitted, ""Many times we knew but did not have the heart to arrest them for they were all women, and each person
sent to prison would have meant leaving nearly 10 children without a mother.""Despite having plenty of natural potential for tourism, according to district Party Secretary Nguyen Quang Hung, Muong Nhe’s total revenues
last year were only VND18 billion, equivalent to the amount collected by Hanoi's Hoan Kiem District in just 15 hours.Most of this VND18 billion ended up going back to the nearly 6,000 poor local households in the form of rice to alleviate hunger during the
lean season, Lunar New Year gifts, funding to build resettlement houses for migrants, and repairs to schools.During his endeavors to find ways to eradicate the cycle of drug addiction, poverty and illiteracy, Hung has often heard officials talk about
Muong Nhe’s mountain peaks for hunting clouds, terraced fields, friendly locals, and well preserved ethnic minority cultures, and yet very few

news,news,Covid-19 vaccination rate sluggish as provinces await supplies,"Until now, there are just 23 of Vietnam's 63 cities and provinces that have finished inoculating all people over 18 with the first shot.Of them, only 12 have fully vaccinated more than 80 percent of their adult population: An Giang, Ba Ria-Vung Tau, Bac Ninh, Dong Nai, Ha Nam, Hanoi, HCMC, Khanh Hoa, Lam Dong, Lang Son, Long An and Quang Ninh.There are now four provinces with a first-dose vaccination rate of less than 70 percent of the adult population: Thanh Hoa, Nghe An, Son La, and Quang Binh; and 11 provinces with a second dose rate of less than 30 percent of their adult population.The northern mountainous province of Son La is now the locality with the lowest vaccination rate in the country, with less than 61 percent of adults having had the first shot and 18 percent of them getting fully vaccinated.Nguyen Tien Dung, director of Son La's Center for Disease Control, said that given the current situation, it would not be until early next year that the province would be able to cover all adults with the second dose.""From now until December-end, we will continue to receive vaccines allocated by the Ministry of Health. The province will do the best it could to cover 75 percent of adults with two doses, but the progress will rely on the ministry's vaccine supply,"" he said.The central province of Ha Tinh, which has administered 1.1 million vaccine doses, has an actual demand of 1.8 million.For now, it does not have enough vaccines to reach the target of fully vaccinating all adults within this year.""Whether that target is achieved or not depends on the Health Ministry,"" said an official of the province’s health department who did not want to be named.A woman receives a Covid-19 vaccine shot in Ha Tinh Province, June 2021. Photo by VnExpress/Duc HungNghe An Province, which neighbors Ha Tinh, has reported a similar situation. The province has administered more than 2.8 million doses and 1.4 million people have got two shots, meaning a full vaccination rate of 56.2 percent.As planned, the province will be provided with enough vaccine to cover all adults with two shots within this year.""Nghe An has enough capacity to achieve the target. What matters most is that the ministry provides enough vaccine so that we can stay on track,"" said a health department representative who wanted to remain unnamed.With a second dose vaccination rate of 25.9 percent, Ha Giang Province is facing several difficulties in boosting the inoculation progress, said its deputy chairman Tran Duc Quy.He said the vaccination for ethnic groups cannot be carried out quickly as expected for a number of reasons, including the mountainous terrain in many places, which make places difficult to get access.At the same time, it needs the village chiefs to call for members of those groups to take the shot, said Quy.The Ministry of Health last week complained about low vaccination rates in certain localities but local authorities then explained that the problem was actually a lack of distributed doses, saying they have not been allocated enough to cover all adults with the first dose, far less the second one.Vietnam has given 67.8 million at least one vaccine shot and 45.1 million people have received two shots.","Vietnam,Vietnam vaccination,Vietnam Covid-19 vaccine"

world,world,Startups eye post-pandemic 'tele-health' revolution,"Using technology to treat patients virtually was a major theme at one of the world's largest tech conferences, which returned to Lisbon this week after Covid-19 forced it to move online in 2020.""These days, most people use their phones for a lot of everyday needs -- why shouldn't healthcare be part of this?"" said Johannes Schildt, whose company Kry lets patients book on-screen medical appointments.""The pandemic has accelerated adoption of these new technologies,"" Schildt told AFP.Sweden-based Kry, which operates in five European countries, is far from the only app designed to do away with the need to physically visit a doctor.And not all of these startups focus on physical health. US-based Calmerry is among a growing number of e-counselling companies that offer video sessions with mental health therapists.Most public healthcare systems offer limited access to such services, or none at all. With subscriptions starting at $42 per week, Calmerry's co-founder Oksana Tolmachova said a key goal was to make therapy more affordable.Other apps are taking a different approach to tackle the explosion in depression and anxiety seen worldwide during the pandemic.Mental health chatbot Woebot also invites users to discuss their problems, but the replies come from artificial intelligence rather than a human therapist.While some may be unnerved by the idea of pouring one's heart out to a piece of software, studies suggest that confiding in a virtual human could encourage people to open up.Woebot's founder Alison Darcy, a clinical research psychologist, said the chatbot avoided the ""baggage and social constructs"" that come with human interactions -- worrying that the other person will judge you, for instance.nd given the dearth of trained therapists compared with the number of people who need help with their mental health, Darcy argued that AI is a valid tool for approaching the problem.""We need to be throwing everything at helping people get well,"" she said.Darcy does not believe chatbots should replace human therapists outright, and AI has been shown to have its limits when it comes to healthcare.The UK's MHRA health regulator expressed concern in March over the symptom-checking software used by tele-health company Babylon, after reports that it failed to recognise some cases of serious conditions.Critics of the shift towards tele-medicine also worry that providers may be tempted to hand patients cheaper virtual appointments when they would prefer to see a doctor face-to-face.Several health startups say the future lies in blending the two.""Digital has a significant part to play, but the physical experience is also vital -- we have physical clinics too in Sweden, Norway and France,"" said Schildt.He also rejected the criticism that not everyone has access to services such as Kry, which require a smartphone or computer and a decent internet connection.Kry has patients in their 90s who manage to find their way around its technology, Schildt said.Overall, he insisted, ""digital widens access"" to healthcare.One remaining challenge is that legislation in many countries has yet to catch up with the tele-medicine revolution, although that has started changing in recent years.Virtual appointments have been available via France's public healthcare system since 2018, while Germany started allowing doctors to prescribe the use of apps, such as weight trackers, last year.And in between appointments, patients can continue to monitor their health remotely thanks to yet more startups.Ana Maiques, co-founder of Barcelona-based Neuroelectrics, showed a crowd at the Web Summit how a helmet developed by the company can monitor patients' brains from their homes.The device uses sensors to show the activity in different parts of the brain and can even pulse electricity into targeted areas, helping to treat conditions such as epilepsy remotely.Spanish football legend Iker Casillas, meanwhile, is among the investors in Idoven, a startup that uses AI to analyze data from home heart monitoring kits.Its technology is designed to detect irregular heart rhythms that could prove dangerous -- an issue that Casillas cares about deeply, following a heart attack in 2019.""We are the first company in the world capable of doing it,"" the company's CEO Manuel Marina Breysse told AFP.","telehealth,post-pademic"

The offence carries a maximum sentence of life imprisonment.Businessmen Tai and others were bitcoin investors in Ho Chi Minh City and Da Nang. They engaged in transactions with a man named Le, another businessman in HCMC.In 2018, Tai and an accomplice, 38-year-old Tran Ngoc Hoang, sold 1,000 bitcoins worth around VND100 billion and used the money to buy other cryptocurrencies, but ended up losing their investment.

His parents had tried to teach him and two older sisters, even making them go to a Vietnamese class every Sunday, but they never spoke in Vietnamese to each other or to their elders. It was ""quite a common trend"" in migrant Vietnamese families that children who grew up in the U.S. did not speak their mother tongue and gradually lost the ability to use the language though they still ""heard it"" in the family.Ton thought that a Vietnamese class at Brown would be a great initiative for him and others in the same situation.In his second year, Ton took his idea further. He talked to his Vietnamese friends and found that they were also experiencing a similar homesickness. Once they got to college, they felt alone without hearing Vietnamese spoken around them, and regretted that they had not learnt their mother tongue properly in their childhood. It also felt that they were being cut off from their Vietnamese roots. They wanted to reconnect with their culture, and they wanted to do it on their own terms.Ton and some other members in the Brown-RISD Vietnamese Students Association (VSA) then conducted a survey in Brown, asking about students' proficiency levels; and received around 50 responses. Only 30 percent were fluent in Vietnamese, and they all would love to learn the language in an academic environment.Some respondents went further than reconnecting with their families. They suggested that studying the Vietnamese language would enable them do better research on topics related to Vietnamese and American history and culture, including literature.Also, they wanted to travel to Vietnam on their own and check out potential professional opportunities.Ton, president of the Southeast Asian Studies Initiative (SEASI) at Brown, said he was somewhat optimistic about getting the class because Brown always emphasized its interest in having a more diverse community, though he knew it would not be easy.A big challenge in getting the ball rolling was keeping students interested in the idea and convincing the administration that it was a persistent interest, Ton said.The team collected support letters from students and faculty members for an appeal to the university administration to promote diversity via a Vietnamese language class.They had their ""first victory"" in the summer of 2019 when they were told that such a class could be budgeted for.""But Covid happened... and the administration said it had to freeze any hiring process because of the pandemic's financial impact.""It also coincided with the time of Ton's graduation, so he had to find younger members to maintain the momentum.""Luckily, they were excited and motivated.""After Ton left Brown, Malery Nguyen was one of the active members who helped ensure that ""the future class would not disappear.""Malery Nguyen is in the annual Brown-RISD Vietnamese Students Association culture show in March, 2020. Photo courtesy of Andrew TonBorn in Florida, Nguyen had a similar story as Ton's, and felt it was ""essential"" that she learns Vietnamese. At home, she and her younger brother got to listen to their mother tongue, but they typically ""replied in English.""She said: ""One major difficulty in setting up a Vietnamese class at Brown was finding its place in the curriculum as there was no Southeast Asian Studies Department.""It did not fall into any similar language categories. Hence the administration had to find other professors.To push the plan forward, the 22-year-old and her team highlighted the difference between Southeast Asian Studies and East Asian Studies (which is one of the existing departments) and the urgent need for distinguishing them. Nguyen believes that Vietnamese students' attendance, including hers, in history lessons attracted Brown's attention and made the demand for a new language class credible.Nguyen, too, graduated shortly before the class was offered and was very excited to see the turnout for their efforts at Brown and the interest from Princeton University.Princeton, another Ivy League institution in New Jersey, is also offering, for the first time, a course in Vietnamese in partnership with Brown. The course, taught in-person by a lecturer at Brown, is attended via Zoom by two Princeton students from a classroom in East Pyne Hall, according to .She expects more young Vietnamese students to sign up for the class in the future.She is also confident that ""it's going to be a much bigger project.""Bella Hoang, 21, the only member of the team who is still at Brown, did not share Nguyen's confidence.She was afraid that there might not be ""enough momentum"" to keep the class going for long at Brown.Bella Hoang is in the annual Brown-RISD Vietnamese Students Association culture show in March, 2020. Photo courtesy of Andrew TonHoang's main interest in being part of the team was to help form a Southeast Asian major at the university.Mostly involved with VSA, Hoang said she was striving to increase the group's presence on campus to attract students' interest in Vietnam's culture and history.She said she looked forward to seeing SEASI establish further collaboration with other groups to introduce the class to freshmen at Brown. She felt that its image was not popular enough for new students.""I think that creating Southeast Asian studies at our university will help the Vietnamese class become more permanent.""At present, Brown offers two levels of Vietnamese classes for beginners and intermediate level for people having basic knowledge but wish to improve their vocabulary and grammar.Jane Sokolosky, director of the Center for Language Studies at Brown, who Ton described as a ""key player"" in the process and really made things happen, said the Vietnamese team was instrumental in reaching out to her and related people at the Dean’s office and the East Asian Studies department.She emphasized that while less commonly taught languages such as Vietnamese may initially see few students, they are very important.A PhD student at the Yale University now, Ton said he hoped that students at Brown would be aware of this ""amazing opportunity"" for them to maintain the Vietnamese class for future purposes. They should make sure that the university knows that these courses are appreciated and need to convey how important the classes are to the university, so that it is motivated to keep it, he said.Personally, Ton said he would find other ways to learn Vietnamese and visit Vietnam again as an adult. He had visited the country once when he was 11, but did not have many memories of his homeland.""I really want to see things that my sisters and I have been waiting to see from our family's stories. That will be very cool.""","first Vietnamese class,Ivy League school,Brown University,Andrew Ton,grandmother,Malery Nguyen,Bella Hoang"

In 2012, Long opened a clothing shop in Hanoi and had two children with a local woman. They ended their relationship in 2015 after the mother learned of Long’s background.He then asked her family to find a way to provide him a fake ID proving his Vietnamese nationality so he could stay. They then contacted Thuan, who forged a fake ID card for Long using the name of the woman’s brother.On March 20, 2015, Thuan registered for a new ID card, then let his wife Dung bring Long to a police station to finalize the process. Dung received VND20 million ($880.87) in payment.In 2019, Thuan and his wife also helped Min, wanted by Interpol for contract fraud, to forge another fake ID. Min learnt of Thuan’s service via Long.With their fake IDs, Long and Min secured passports and flew back and forth between Vietnam and Thailand, opening bank accounts, signed up for residency and had jobs.Between December 2020 to January 2021, the two were caught by police.In court, Thuan and Dung said they knew Long and Min were foreigners, but did not know they were wanted criminals.Personnel and units responsible for making the fake IDs stated they were indeed mistaken, but lacked any motivation and gained no reward for doing what they did.

At many sections, construction units have had to change the flow of the stream.Ten kilometers along the highway, constructors are experiencing difficulties due to the rocky mountainous terrain.
The contractor, Lao Cai – Sa Pa BOT JSC, is planning to use explosives for land clearance.Dozens of culverts were built underneath the highway to prevent flooding during the rainy season.There are six bridges along the highway, including the Mong Sen viaduct, which has the highest pier in Vietnam, rising 83 meters.Vi Van Mien, 42, works on one of the bridges that crosses a stream. Around 350 workers are currently deployed on the project.The new highway (R) runs parallel to the existing route connecting Hanoi with Sa Pa, National Highway 4D.
The new route shortens the total distance by seven kilometers (4.35 miles), and allows travelers to avoid several dangerous turns.Links have also been built to connect National Highway 4D with the new route.
Once the new highway enters use, toll stations would be placed at the Mong Sen viaduct in a way people could still choose to use the old route without paying a fee.A section of the highway that has recently been cleared for construction.","Vietnam,Noi Bai - Lao Cai Expressway,Hanoi to Sa Pa,construction,roads,infrastructure,transport"

news,news,Covid forces workers to quit social security,"In the first 10 months of this year more than 700,000 people registered to exit the social insurance scheme and withdraw the accumulated premiums they and their and employers had paid, 5.5 percent more than in the same period last year, the VSS said.To be eligible for retirement pensions, employees need to pay the premium for at least 20 years.In most cases the withdrawal was due to the economic stress caused by the Covid-19 pandemic, especially in economic and industrial hubs like Ho Chi Minh City and Binh Duong and Dong Nai provinces, the VSS said.It is ""a matter of concern"" that people are quitting the social insurance scheme since this would directly affect both labor rights and social welfare, it said.According to current regulations, the condition for employees to withdraw the accumulated premiums is that they have been unemployed for a year and paid social insurance premiums for less than 20 years.Le Minh Ly, director of the Binh Duong Social Security, said most workers in the province are migrants, and decided to leave for their hometowns when they lost their jobs.""As they need money to start a new life, the one-time social insurance withdrawal is normally their first choice,"" especially with the pandemic threatening to make it hard to find new jobs, she said.She feared that, with the pandemic continuing to have an economic impact, more people would register to exit the social security system.The VSS warned that while the withdrawal would allow workers to meet their immediate financial needs, it would take away their post-retirement pension, health insurance cover and death benefits.In the long run a large rate of seniors without pensions would place great pressure on social security, it said.A report published in April by the Hanoi University of Social Sciences and Humanities and Germany’s Justus Liebig University Giessen, ‘Vietnam as an Ageing Society,’ said 64 percent of Vietnam’s 13.4 million people of retirement age did not currently have a pension.Nearly 46 percent of people aged 60-64, 30 percent of people aged 70-79, and 10 percent of people over 80 still had to work for a living, it said.Contracted workers have to pay social insurance premiums for a full 20 years to qualify for a pension when they retire, currently at 60 years and three months for men and at 55 years and four months for women.The Ministry of Labor, Invalids and Social Affairs had in April proposed that workers should be made eligible for a pension if they pay social insurance for just 10-15 years, saying 20 years is too long.It has also caused many to quit as a result. Meanwhile, in case laborers get employed with contracts again, they will have to start paying the insurance all over from scratch to reach the 20-year period, the ministry said in proposed amendments to the Law on Social Insurance.","Vietnam,Vietnam Covid-19,Vietnam Covid-19 impacts,Vietnam social insurance"

news,news,Reduced quarantine for vaccinated Covid-19 patients feasible: experts,"The proposal, sent recently to the Ministry of Health, suggests reducing the quarantine time from 14 to seven days for Covid-19 patients who are fully vaccinated and have mild symptoms, if they test negative on the 7th day.This will ease the burden for treatment facilities, it said.Experts agree that the municipal health department's proposal is practical, even desirable.Doctor Do Van Dung, head of the Public Health Department at the HCMC University of Medicine and Pharmacology, said shortening the quarantine period will have many positive impacts on pandemic prevention and control.A shorter period of isolation and treatment will make the patients feel more comfortable, which can help them recover sooner than expected. It will also reduce financial costs for the healthcare system, he said.Doctor Do Cao Van Anh, lecturer at the Pham Ngoc Thach University of Medicine, said that with hindsight, it can be seen that quarantining patients for 14 days, and at some point, 21 days, had created quite a few difficulties for the medical sector and had high human resource costs.Epidemiologist Truong Huu Khanh, a consultant with the infectious and neurological diseases department at the city's Children's Hospital No.1, said quarantining up to 14 days for fully vaccinated patients with mild symptoms and negative test results is causing ""unnecessary overload.""""What's most important now is medical manpower. Medics need to be given priority so that they can focus their efforts on saving critical patients rather than treating those that have already tested negative,"" he said.In the health department’s proposal, director Tang Chi Thuong said that since HCMC started using molnupiravir, an antiviral drug approved in Vietnam for Covid-19 treatment, most patients have recovered and tested negative after one week.However, as currently regulated, every patient has to stay at treatment facilities for 14 days, and this has overloaded them.Meanwhile, in recent weeks, HCMC has recorded a decrease in the number of patients; but many of them still do not live in houses that meet conditions for self-treatment.Doctor Anh said cutting the quarantine time to seven days is totally ""possible and reasonable.""Covid-19 patients who are asymptomatic or have mild symptoms can recover after a week and in most cases, there is little or even no chance that they could spread the virus to others.""On the other hand, treating Covid-19 with antiviral drugs is becoming a trend worldwide and Vietnam has already applied it. If medical staff can guide patients on using it and keep a close eye on them, it is completely possible to have patients discharged after seven days.The important issue then is preparing sufficient quantities of drugs for all Covid-19 patients.For now, molnupiravir is being used on a trial basis in Vietnam, and any patients wanting to use it have to sign a consent form.Doctor Dung suggested that those using the drug be allowed a shortened quarantine period of seven days and those not using it be isolated for at least 10 days.""The treatment of Covid-19 with the antiviral drug molnupiravir has been quite effective, and the drug has shown very good virus-killing effect.""""Some studies have showed that after taking the drug for five days, the risk of spreading the virus no longer exists,"" he said.For patients not using the drug, recent studies indicate that around half develop breathing difficulties around the eighth day after showing the first Covid-19 symptoms and testing positive.Therefore, such people should not leave treatment facilities after a week so as to prevent the possibility of their becoming critical without immediate medical help.He said that for now, the decision to release a Covid-19 patient should be based on their actual symptoms rather than test results as has been regulated so far.""A person can certainly go home when he/she no longer shows any Covid-19 symptom 10 days after showing symptoms for the first time,"" he said.He also quoted a recommendation made by the U.S. Center for Disease Control and Prevention back in September: ""For most children and adults with symptomatic SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes Covid-19, infection, isolation, and precautions can be discontinued 10 days after onset of symptoms and after resolution of fever for at least 24 hours and improvement of other symptoms, and for people who are infected but asymptomatic (never develop symptoms), isolation and precautions can be discontinued 10 days after the first positive test.""","HCMC,HCMC Covid-19 patients,HCMC Covid-19 treatment"
